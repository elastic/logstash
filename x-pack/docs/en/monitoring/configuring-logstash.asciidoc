=== Configuring Monitoring for Logstash Nodes
++++
<titleabbrev>Configuring Monitoring</titleabbrev>
++++

To monitor Logstash nodes:

. Identify where to send monitoring data. This cluster is often referred to as
the _production cluster_. For examples of typical monitoring architectures, see
{xpack-ref}/how-monitoring-works.html[How Monitoring Works].
+
--
IMPORTANT: To visualize Logstash as part of the Elastic Stack (as shown in Step
6), send metrics to your _production_ cluster. Sending metrics to a dedicated
monitoring cluster will show the Logstash metrics under the _monitoring_ cluster.

--

. Verify that the `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting is `true` on the
production cluster. If that setting is `false`, the collection of monitoring data
is disabled in {es} and data is ignored from all other sources.

. Configure your Logstash nodes to send metrics by setting the
`xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url` in `logstash.yml`. If {security} is enabled,
you also need to specify the credentials for the 
{stack-ov}/built-in-users.html[built-in `logstash_system` user]. For more information about these settings, see <<monitoring-settings>>.
+
--
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url: ["http://es-prod-node-1:9200", "http://es-prod-node-2:9200"] <1>
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username: "logstash_system" <2>
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: "changeme"
--------------------------------------------------
<1> If SSL/TLS is enabled on the production cluster, you must
connect through HTTPS. As of v5.2.1, you can specify multiple
Elasticsearch hosts as an array as well as specifying a single
host as a string. If multiple URLs are specified, Logstash
can round-robin requests to these production nodes.
<2> If {security} is disabled on the production cluster, you can omit these 
`username` and `password` settings. 
--

. If SSL/TLS is enabled on the production {es} cluster, specify the trusted
CA certificates that will be used to verify the identity of the nodes
in the cluster.
+
--
To add a CA certificate to a Logstash node's trusted certificates, you
can specify the location of the PEM encoded certificate with the
`ca` setting:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.ca: /path/to/ca.crt
--------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can configure trusted certificates using a truststore
(a Java Keystore file that contains the certificates):

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path: /path/to/file
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.password: password
--------------------------------------------------

Also, optionally, you can set up client certificate using a keystore
(a Java Keystore file that contains the certificate):

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path: /path/to/file
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.password: password
--------------------------------------------------

Set sniffing to `true` to enable discovery of other nodes of the {es} cluster.
It defaults to `false`.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.sniffing: false
--------------------------------------------------

--

. Restart your Logstash nodes.

. To verify your {monitoring} configuration, point your web browser at your {kib}
host, and select **Monitoring** from the side navigation. Metrics reported from
your Logstash nodes should be visible in the Logstash section. When security is
enabled, to view the monitoring dashboards you must log in to {kib} as a user
who has the `kibana_user` and `monitoring_user` roles.

==== Re-enabling Logstash Monitoring After Upgrading

When upgrading from older versions of {xpack}, the built-in `logstash_system`
user is disabled for security reasons. To resume monitoring,
{xpack-ref}/monitoring-troubleshooting.html[change the password and re-enable the logstash_system user].
