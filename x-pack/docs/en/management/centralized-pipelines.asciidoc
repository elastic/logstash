=== Centralized Pipeline Management

The pipeline management feature centralizes the creation and
management of Logstash configuration pipelines. 

NOTE: Centralized pipeline management is an {xpack} feature that is not included
with the basic license. If you want to try all of the features, you can start a
30-day trial. At the end of the trial period, you can purchase a subscription to
keep using the full functionality of the {xpack} components. For more
information, see https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions and
{stack-ov}/license-management.html[License
Management].

From within the pipeline
management UI in {kib}, you can control multiple Logstash instances. You can
add, edit, and delete pipeline configurations. On the Logstash side, you simply
need to enable configuration management and register Logstash to use the
centrally managed pipeline configurations.

The pipeline configurations, along with some metadata, are stored in
Elasticsearch. Any changes that you make to a pipeline definition in the UI are
picked up and loaded automatically by all Logstash instances registered to use
the pipeline. The changes are applied immediately; you do not have to restart
Logstash to pick up the changes, as long as Logstash is already registered to
use the pipeline.

NOTE: Centralized management is disabled until you configure and enable
{security}.

==== Managing Pipelines

Before using the pipeline management UI, you must:

* <<configuring-centralized-pipelines, Configure centralized pipeline management>>.
* If {kib} is protected with basic authentication, make sure your {kib} user has
the `logstash_admin` role as well as the `logstash_writer` role that you created
when you <<ls-security,configured Logstash to use basic authentication>>. 

To centrally manage Logstash pipelines:

. Open {kib} in your browser and go to the Management tab. If you've set up
configuration management correctly, you'll see an area for managing Logstash.
Click the *Pipelines* link.

. To add a new pipeline, click the *Add* button and specify values for the
following fields:

[horizontal]
Pipeline ID::
A name that uniquely identifies the pipeline. This is the ID that you used when
you
<<configuring-centralized-pipelines,configured centralized pipeline management>>
and specified a list of pipeline IDs in the `xpack.management.pipeline.id`
setting.

Description::
A description of the pipeline configuration. This information is for your use.

Pipeline::
The pipeline configuration. You can treat the editor in the pipeline management
UI like any other editor. You don't have to worry about whitespace or indentation.

. Click *Save*.

The pipeline runs on all Logstash instances that are registered to use the
pipeline. There is no validation done at the UI level. The UI will save the new
configuration, and Logstash will attempt to load it. You need to check the local
Logstash logs for configuration errors. If you're using the Logstash monitoring
feature in {xpack}, you can also navigate to the Monitoring tab to check the
status of your Logstash nodes.

You can specify multiple pipeline configurations that run in parallel on the
same Logstash node.

If you edit a pipeline configuration and save the changes, Logstash reloads
the configuration in the background and continues processing events.

If you delete a pipeline (for example, `apache`) from the UI, Logstash will
attempt to stop the pipeline if it's running. Logstash will wait until all
events have been fully processed by the pipeline. Before deleting a pipeline,
make sure you understand your data sources because stopping a pipeline may
lead to data loss.
