# Settings file in YAML
#
# Settings can be specified either in hierarchical form, e.g.:
#
#   pipeline:
#     batch:
#       size: 125
#       delay: 5
#
# Or as flat keys:
#
#   pipeline.batch.size: 125
#   pipeline.batch.delay: 5
#
# ------------  Node identity ------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
# node.name: test
#
# If omitted the node name will default to the machine's host name
#
# ------------ Pipeline Settings --------------
#
# Set the number of workers that will, in parallel, execute the filters+outputs
# stage of the pipeline.
#
# This defaults to half the number of the host's CPU cores.
#
# pipeline.workers: 2
#
# How many workers should be used per output plugin instance
#
# pipeline.output.workers: 1
#
# How many events to retrieve from inputs before sending to filters+workers
#
# pipeline.batch.size: 125
#
# How long to wait before dispatching an undersized batch to filters+workers
# Value is in seconds.
#
# pipeline.batch.delay: 5
#
# Force Logstash to exit during shutdown even if there are still inflight
# events in memory. By default, logstash will refuse to quit until all
# received events have been pushed to the outputs.
#
# WARNING: enabling this can lead to data loss during shutdown
#
# pipeline.unsafe_shutdown: false
#
# ------------ Pipeline Configuration Settings --------------
#
# Allow the pipeline configuration to be injected with environment variables
#
# config.allow_env: false
#
# Where to fetch the pipeline configuration for the main pipeline
#
# config.path:
#
# PIpeline configuration string for the main pipeline
#
# config.string:
#
# At startup, test if the configuration is valid and exit (dry run)
#
# config.test: false
#
# Periodically check if the configuration has changed and reload the pipeline
# This can also be triggered manually through the SIGHUP signal
#
# config.auto_reload: false
#
# How often to check if the pipeline configuration has changed (in seconds)
#
# config.reload_interval", Numeric, 3),
#
# ------------ Metrics Settings --------------
#
# Collect metrics?
# WARNING: Enabling this has a performance impact
#
# metric.collect: false
#
# Bind address for the metrics REST endpoint
#
# web_api.http.host: "127.0.0.1"
#
# Bind port for the metrics REST endpoint
# web_api.http.port: 9600
#
# ------------ Debugging Settings --------------
#
# debug: false
# quiet: false
# verbose: false
# debug.config: false
# log.path:
