# Style Guide 

Rather than write a full style guide, please follow by examples you see in the
code. If you send me a patch, I will not reject it for style reasons (but I
will fix it before it gets committed).

## Logging

We support logging structured data, so please do that.

Rather than this:

    @logger.info("Some error occured in request #{request} on input #{input} from client #{ip}")

Do this:
    
    @logger.info("Some error occured in this request", :request => request, :input => input, :client => ip)

## Code Style

* comment everything you can think of.
* indentation: 2 spaces
* between methods: 1 line
* sort your requires
* long lines should wrap at 80 characters. If you wrap at an operator ('or',
  '+', etc) start the next line with that operator.
* parentheses on function definitions/calls
* explicit is better than implicit
  * implicit returns are forbidden except in the case of a single expression 

The point is consistency and documentation. If you see inconsistencies, let me
know, and I'll fix them :)

Short example:

      require "something from a gem" # from gem 'thing'

      # some documentation about this class
      class Foo < Bar
        # some documentation about this function
        def somefunc(arg1, arg2, arg3)
          # comment
          puts "Hello"
          if (some_long_condition \
              or some_other_condition)
            puts "World"
          end # if <very short description>

          # Long lines should wrap and start with an operator if possible.
          foo = some + long + formula + thing \
                + stuff + bar;

          # Function calls, when wrapping, should align to the '(' where reasonable.
          some_function_call(arg1, arg2, arg3, some_long_thing,
                             alignment_here, arg6)
          # If it seems unreasonable, wrap and indent 4 spaces.
          some_really_long_function_call_blah_blah_blah(arg1,
              arg2, arg3, arg4)

          # indent the 'when' inside a 'case'.
          case foo
            when "bar"
              puts "Hello world"
            when /testing/
              puts "testing
            else
              puts "I got nothin'"
          end # case foo
            
        end # def somefunc
      end # class Foo

## Specific cases

### Hash Syntax

Use of the "hash colon" syntax (ruby 1.9) is not accepted.

    # This is NOT good.
    { foo: "bar" }

    # This is good.
    { :foo => "bar" }

### String#[]

String#[] with one numeric argument must not be used due to bugs and
inconsistencies between ruby versions.

    str = "foo"

    # This is NOT good
    str[0]

    # This is good.
    str[0, 1]
