# Run logstash from source

# This is most useful when done from a git checkout.
#
# Usage:
#     bin/logstash <command> [arguments]
#
# See 'bin/logstash help' for a list of commands.
#
# NOTE: One extra command is available 'deps'
# The 'deps' command will install dependencies for logstash.

# Defaults you can override with environment variables
