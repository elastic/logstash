# Run logstash from source
#
# This is most useful when done from a git checkout.

# Usage:
#   bin/logstash <command> [arguments]
#
# See 'bin/logstash --help' for a list of commands.
#
# Supported environment variables:
#   LS_JAVA_OPTS="xxx" to append extra options to the JVM options provided by logstash
#
# Development environment variables:
#   DEBUG=1 to output debugging information
