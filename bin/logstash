#!/bin/sh
# Run logstash from source
#
# This is most useful when done from a git checkout.
#
# Usage:
#     bin/logstash <command> [arguments]
#
# See 'bin/logstash help' for a list of commands.
#
# NOTE: One extra command is available 'deps'
# The 'deps' command will install dependencies for logstash.
#
# If you do not have ruby installed, you can set "USE_JRUBY=1"
# in your environment and this script will download and use
# a release of JRuby for you.

# Defaults you can override with environment variables
