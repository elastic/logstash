# Run logstash from source
#
# This is most useful when done from a git checkout.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/logstash <command> [arguments]
#
# See 'bin/logstash --help' for a list of commands.
#
# Supported environment variables:
#   LS_JVM_OPTS="xxx" path to file with JVM options
#   LS_JAVA_OPTS="xxx" to append extra options to the defaults JAVA_OPTS provided by logstash
#   JAVA_OPTS="xxx" to *completely override* the default set of JAVA_OPTS provided by logstash
#
# Development environment variables:
#   USE_RUBY=1 to force use the local "ruby" command to launch logstash instead of using the vendored JRuby
#   USE_DRIP=1 to force use drip
#   DEBUG=1 to output debugging information
