[[ls-k8s-quick-start]]
== Quick start

WARNING: This documentation is still in development and may be changed or removed in a future release.

This guide describes how to set up {ls} to deliver Kubernetes logs to {es}. The logs will be monitored by Filebeat, processed through a Logstash pipeline, and then delivered into an {es} cluster in the Kubernetes environment.

This section includes the following topics:

* <<qs-prerequisites>>
* <<qs-set-up>>
* <<qs-generate-certificate>>
* <<qs-create-elastic-stack>>
* <<qs-view-monitoring-data>>
* <<qs-tidy-up>>
* <<qs-learn-more>>

[[qs-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

Before you start, there are a few things you'll need:

. A running Kubernetes cluster - For single node testing we recommend using link:https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io[Minikube], which allows you to easily run a single node Kubernetes cluster on your system. Check the `Getting Started` section for install and set up instructions.
. A link:https://github.com/elastic/logstash/blob/feature/kubernetes/k8s/recipes/logstash-k8s-quickstart.zip[small zip file] of config files - Download and expand this archive into an empty directory on your local system. The files are described in <<sample-configuration-files,Sample configuration files>>.

[[qs-set-up]]
=== Set up your environment

Let's start by getting your Minikube Kubernetes cluster up and running:

[source,sh]
--
minikube start
--

Install the Elastic custom resource definition (CRD) files, as well as the `elastic-operator` custom controller, which will be used to manage the Elastic resources in your cluster:

[source,sh]
--
kubectl create -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/2.4.0/crds.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/2.4.0/operator.yaml
--

NOTE: The Elastic CRDs and ECK operator can also be set up using Elastic Helm charts, available at link:https://helm.elastic.co[https://helm.elastic.co].

Check the Kubernetes pods status to confirm that the `elastic-operator` pod is running:

[source,sh]
--
kubectl get pods
--

[source,sh]
--
NAME                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
elastic-operator-0   1/1     Running   4 (12m ago)   13d
--

[float]
[[qs-generate-certificate]]
=== Generate certificate files

To enable secure communication throughout your Kubernetes resources, run the sample script to generate the CA certificate files. Details about these files are in <<sample-configuration-files,Sample configuration files>>.

[source,sh]
--
./cert/generate_cert.sh
--

Your `logstash-k8s-gs/cert` folder should now contain a set of certificate files, including `client` certificates for Filebeat and Metricbeat, and `server` certificates for Logstash. 

The parent `logstash-k8s-gs` directory also has a new `001-secret.yaml` resources file that stores a hash of the client and server certificates.

[[qs-create-elastic-stack]]
=== Create an Elastic Stack

Now that your environment and certificates are set up, it's time to create an Elastic Stack. Run the following command to deploy the example using the sample CRDs:

[source,sh]
--
kubectl apply -f .
--

The resources are created:

[source,sh]
--
elasticsearch.elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/demo created
configmap/logstash-pipeline created
configmap/logstash-config created
secret/logstash-beats-tls created
deployment.apps/logstash created
service/logstash created
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/logstash created
beat.beat.k8s.elastic.co/demo created
beat.beat.k8s.elastic.co/demo configured
kibana.kibana.k8s.elastic.co/demo created
--

[source,sh]
--
kubectl get pods
--

The pods are starting up. You may need to wait a minute or two for all of them to be ready.

[source,sh]
--
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
demo-beat-filebeat-7f4d97f69f-qkkbl     1/1     Running   0              42s
demo-beat-metricbeat-59f4b68cc7-9zrrn   1/1     Running   0              39s

[[qs-view-monitoring-data]]
=== View the stack monitoring data

Now that your stack monitoring data is flowing, let's access it in {kib}. 

First, enable port forwarding for the {kib} service on port `5601`. Open a second shell window and run the following:

[source,sh]
--
kubectl port-forward service/demo-kb-http 5601
--

Then, open up a web browser at address `https://localhost:5601`. Depending on your browser you may need to accept the site certificate.

Log in to {kib} using the `elastic` username and password. To obtain the password, run:

[source,sh]
--
kubectl get secret demo-es-elastic-user -o=jsonpath='{.data.elastic}' | base64 --decode; echo
--

Open the {kib} main menu and select **Management**, then **Stack Monitoring**.

Select the {ls} **Overview**, and under the **Nodes** tab select the link for the {ls} node.

image::./images/gs-logstash-node-metrics.png[{ls} metrics data in {kib}]

That's it! The Kubernetes API server metrics data is flowing through {ls} into {es} and {kib}. You can monitor the JVM Heap, CPU Utilization, and System Load data as it updates in real time.

[float]
[[qs-tidy-up]]
=== Tidy up

After finishing with this demo, you can run the following command to remove all of the created resources:
 
[source,sh]
--
kubectl delete service,pods,deployment,hpa,configmap,secret,beat,elasticsearch,kibana -l app=logstash-demo
--

[[qs-learn-more]]
=== Learn more

Now that you're familiar with how to get a {ls} monitoring setup running in your Kubernetes environment, here are a few suggested next steps:

* <<ls-k8s-external-resource>>
* <<ls-k8s-design-for-plugins>>
* <<ls-k8s-sizing>>
* <<ls-k8s-secure>>
* <<ls-k8s-stack-monitoring>>

As well, we have a variety of <<ls-k8s-recipes,recipes>> that you can use as templates to configure an environment to match your specific use case.
