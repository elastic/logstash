== Introduction

WARNING: This documentation is still in development and may be changed or removed in a future release.

This guide helps you to run and work with {ls} in a Kubernetes environment.

Are you trying out {ls} for the first time? We recommend beginning with our guide {logstash-ref}/getting-started-with-logstash.html[Getting Started with Logstash].

If you're already familiar with Logstash, then it's time to try it out in Kubernetes. The <<ls-k8s-quick-start,Getting started with Logstash and Kubernetes>> demo guides you through the steps of configuring Logstash inside a running Kubernetes cluster.
