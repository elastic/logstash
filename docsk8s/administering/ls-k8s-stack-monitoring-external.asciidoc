==== Ship metrics to external {es} cluster

TIP: Be sure that you have the Elastic CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) installed so that you can follow the example. Check out <<qs-set-up>> for set up info.

Metrics can be sent to an {es} cluster that is not managed by ECK. To configure {metricbeat}, remove the `elasticsearchRef` from the specification and include an output configuration in the `spec.config`.
