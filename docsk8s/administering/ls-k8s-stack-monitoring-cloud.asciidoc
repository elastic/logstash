==== Ship metrics to Elastic Cloud

TIP: Be sure that you have the Elastic CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) installed so that you can follow the example. Check out <<qs-set-up>> for set up info.

You can configure {metricbeat} to send monitoring data to a hosted {ess} on https://cloud.elastic.co/[Elastic Cloud]. To send to Elastic Cloud, remove the `elasticsearchRef` from the `spec` and set the `cloud.id` and `cloud.auth` for your https://cloud.elastic.co/[Elastic Cloud] monitoring cluster in the `spec.config` section of the {metricbeat} configuration.
