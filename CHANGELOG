  - Redis input and output are now supported. (Contributed by dokipen)
  - Add shutdown processing. Shutdown starts when all inputs finish (like
    stdin). The shutdown sequence always starts the inputs. The sequence
    progresses using the same pipeline as the inputs/filters/outputs, so all
    in-flight events should finish getting processed before the final shutdown
    event makes it's way to the outputs.
  - Add retries to unhandled input exceptions (LOGSTASH-84)
