      flag:
        # Note: Wrap these at 45 chars so they display nicely when clamp emits
        # them in an 80-character terminal
        config: |+
          Load the logstash config from a specific file
          or directory.  If a directory is given, all
          files in that directory will be concatenated
          in lexicographical order and then parsed as a
          single config file. You can also specify
          wildcards (globs) and any matched files will
          be loaded in the order described above.
        config-string: |+
          Use the given string as the configuration
          data. Same syntax as the config file. If no
          input is specified, then 'stdin 
          { type => stdin }' is the default input.
          If no output is specified, then  'stdout
          { codec => rubydebug } }' is default output.
        configtest: |+
          Check configuration, then exit.
        filterworkers: |+
          Sets the number of filter workers to run.
        watchdog-timeout: |+
          Set the filter watchdog timeout (in seconds).
          This timeout is used to detect stuck filters;
          stuck filters usually symptoms of bugs.
          When a filter takes longer than TIMEOUT
          seconds, it will cause logstash to abort.
        log: |+
          Write logstash internal logs to the given
          file. Without this flag, logstash will emit
          logs to standard output.
        verbosity: |+
          Increase verbosity of logstash internal logs.
          Specifying once will show 'informational'
          logs. Specifying twice will show 'debug'
          logs. This flag is deprecated. You should use
          --verbose or --debug instead.
        version: |+
          Emit the version of logstash and its friends,
          then exit.
        pluginpath: |+
          A path of where to find plugins. This flag
          can be given multiple times to include
          multiple paths. Plugins are expected to be
          in a specific directory hierarchy:
          'PATH/logstash/TYPE/NAME.rb' where TYPE is
          'inputs' 'filters', 'outputs' or 'codecs'
          and NAME is the name of the plugin.
        quiet: |+
          Quieter logstash logging. This causes only 
          errors to be emitted.
        verbose: |+
          More verbose logging. This causes 'info' 
          level logs to be emitted.
        debug: |+
          Most verbose logging. This causes 'debug'
          level logs to be emitted.
