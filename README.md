# BE AWARE! Fork of Logstash

[Why JRuby by Jordan Sissel](https://gist.github.com/jordansissel/978956)?

Logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. You can use it to collect
logs, parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching). Speaking
of searching, logstash comes with a web interface for searching and drilling
into all of your logs.

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you
are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

For more info, see <http://logstash.net/>
