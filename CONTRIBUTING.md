# Contributing to Logstash

All contributions are welcome: ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports,
complaints, etc!

Programming is not a required skill, and there are many ways to help out!
It is more important to us that you are able to contribute.

That said, some basic guidelines, which you are free to ignore :)

## Want to learn?

Want to lurk about and see what others are doing with Logstash? 

* The irc channel (#logstash on irc.freenode.org) is a good place for this
* The [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/logstash) is also
  great for learning from others.

## Got Questions?

Have a problem you want Logstash to solve for you? 

* You can ask a question in the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/logstash)
* Alternately, you are welcome to join the IRC channel #logstash on
irc.freenode.org and ask for help there!

## Have an Idea or Feature Request?

* File a ticket on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues). Please remember that GitHub is used only for issues and feature requests. If you have a general question, the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/logstash) or IRC would be the best place to ask.

## Something Not Working? Found a Bug?

If you think you found a bug, it probably is a bug.

* If it is a general Logstash or a pipeline issue, file it in [Logstash GitHub](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/issues)
* If it is specific to a plugin, please file it in the respective repository under [logstash-plugins](https://github.com/logstash-plugins)
* or ask the [forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/logstash).

Please note that Pull Requests without tests will not be merged. If you would like to contribute but do not have experience with writing tests, please ping us on IRC/forum or create a PR and ask our help.
