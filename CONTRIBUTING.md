# Contributing to logstash

All contributions are welcome: ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports,
complaints, etc!

Programming is not a required skill, and there are many ways to help out!
It is more important to us that you are able to contribute.

That said, some basic guidelines, which you are free to ignore :)

# Contributing Documentation and Code Changes

logstash, and you think it will take more than a few minutes to produce the fix
(ie; write code), it is worth discussing the change with the logstash users and developers first! You can reach us via [jira](https://logstash.jira.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa), the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/logstash-users), or via IRC (#logstash on freenode irc)
