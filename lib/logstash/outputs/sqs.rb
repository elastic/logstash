# Push events to an Amazon Web Services Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue.
#
# SQS is a simple, scalable queue system that is part of the 
# Amazon Web Services suite of tools.
#
# Although SQS is similar to other queuing systems like AMQP, it
# uses a custom API and requires that you have an AWS account.
# See http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/ for more details on how SQS works,
# what the pricing schedule looks like and how to setup a queue.
#
# To use this plugin, you *must*:
#
#  * Have an AWS account
#  * Setup an SQS queue
#  * Create an identify that has access to publish messages to the queue.
#
# The "consumer" identity must have the following permissions on the queue:
#
#  * sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility
#  * sqs:ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch
#  * sqs:GetQueueAttributes
#  * sqs:GetQueueUrl
#  * sqs:ListQueues
#  * sqs:SendMessage
#  * sqs:SendMessageBatch
#
# Typically, you should setup an IAM policy, create a user and apply the IAM policy to the user.
# A sample policy is as follows:
#
#      {
#        "Statement": [
#          {
#            "Sid": "Stmt1347986764948",
#            "Action": [
#              "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility",
#              "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch",
#              "sqs:DeleteMessage",
#              "sqs:DeleteMessageBatch",
#              "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
#              "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
#              "sqs:ListQueues",
#              "sqs:ReceiveMessage"
#            ],
#            "Effect": "Allow",
#            "Resource": [
#              "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:200850199751:Logstash"
#            ]
#          }
#        ]
#      }
#
# See http://aws.amazon.com/iam/ for more details on setting up AWS identities.
