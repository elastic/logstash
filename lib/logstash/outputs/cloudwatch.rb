# This output lets you aggregate and send metric data to AWS CloudWatch
#
# #### Summary:
# This plugin is intended to be used on a logstash indexer agent (but that
# is not the only way, see below.)  In the intended scenario, one cloudwatch
# output plugin is configured, on the logstash indexer node, with just AWS API
# credentials, and possibly a region and/or a namespace.  The output looks
# for fields present in events, and when it finds them, it uses them to
# calculate aggregate statistics.  If the `metricname` option is set in this
# output, then any events which pass through it will be aggregated & sent to
# CloudWatch, but that is not recommended.  The intended use is to NOT set the
# metricname option here, and instead to add a `CW_metricname` field (and other
# fields) to only the events you want sent to CloudWatch.
#
# When events pass through this output they are queued for background
# aggregation and sending, which happens every minute by default.  The
# queue has a maximum size, and when it is full aggregated statistics will be
# sent to CloudWatch ahead of schedule. Whenever this happens a warning
# message is written to logstash's log.  If you see this you should increase
# the `queue_size` configuration option to avoid the extra API calls.  The queue
# is emptied every time we send data to CloudWatch.
#
# Note: when logstash is stopped the queue is destroyed before it can be processed.
# This is a known limitation of logstash and will hopefully be addressed in a
# future version.
#
# #### Details:
# There are two ways to configure this plugin, and they can be used in
# combination: event fields & per-output defaults
#
# Event Field configuration...
# You add fields to your events in inputs & filters and this output reads
# those fields to aggregate events.  The names of the fields read are
# configurable via the `field_*` options.
#
# Per-output defaults...
# You set universal defaults in this output plugin's configuration, and
# if an event does not have a field for that option then the default is
# used.
#
# Notice, the event fields take precedence over the per-output defaults.
#
# At a minimum events must have a "metric name" to be sent to CloudWatch.
# This can be achieved either by providing a default here OR by adding a
# `CW_metricname` field. By default, if no other configuration is provided
# besides a metric name, then events will be counted (Unit: Count, Value: 1)
# by their metric name (either a default or from their `CW_metricname` field)
#
# Other fields which can be added to events to modify the behavior of this
# plugin are, `CW_namespace`, `CW_unit`, `CW_value`, and 
# `CW_dimensions`.  All of these field names are configurable in
# this output.  You can also set per-output defaults for any of them.
# See below for details.
