# INFORMATION:

# This plugin was created for store the logstash's events into Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
# For use it you needs authentications and an s3 bucket.
# Be careful to have the permission to write file on S3's bucket and run logstash with super user for establish connection.
#
# S3 plugin allows you to do something complex, let's explain:)
#
# S3 outputs create temporary files into "/opt/logstash/S3_temp/". If you want, you can change the path at the start of register method.
# This files have a special name, for example:
#
# ls.s3.ip-10-228-27-95.2013-04-18T10.00.tag_hello.part0.txt
#
# ls.s3 : indicate logstash plugin s3
#
# "ip-10-228-27-95" : indicate you ip machine, if you have more logstash and writing on the same bucket for example.
# "2013-04-18T10.00" : represents the time whenever you specify time_file.
# "tag_hello" : this indicate the event's tag, you can collect events with the same tag.
# "part0" : this means if you indicate size_file then it will generate more parts if you file.size > size_file.
#           When a file is full it will pushed on bucket and will be deleted in temporary directory.
#           If a file is empty is not pushed, but deleted.
#
# This plugin have a system to restore the previous temporary files if something crash.
#
##[Note] :
#
## If you specify size_file and time_file then it will create file for each tag (if specified), when time_file or
## their size > size_file, it will be triggered then they will be pushed on s3's bucket and will delete from local disk.
## If you don't specify size_file, but time_file then it will create only one file for each tag (if specified).
## When time_file it will be triggered then the files will be pushed on s3's bucket and delete from local disk.
#
## If you don't specify time_file, but size_file  then it will create files for each tag (if specified),
## that will be triggered when their size > size_file, then they will be pushed on s3's bucket and will delete from local disk.
#
## If you don't specific size_file and time_file you have a curios mode. It will create only one file for each tag (if specified).
## Then the file will be rest on temporary directory and don't will be pushed on bucket until we will restart logstash.
#
#
# #### Usage:
# This is an example of logstash config:
#
#    output {
#       s3{
#         access_key_id => "crazy_key"             (required)
#         secret_access_key => "monkey_access_key" (required)
#         endpoint_region => "eu-west-1"           (required)
#         bucket => "boss_please_open_your_bucket" (required)
#         size_file => 2048                        (optional)
#         time_file => 5                           (optional)
#         canned_acl => "private"                  (optional. Options are "private", "public_read", "public_read_write", "authenticated_read". Defaults to "private" )
#       }
#    }
