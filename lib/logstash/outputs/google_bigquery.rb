# Summary: plugin to upload log events to Google BigQuery (BQ), rolling
# files based on the date pattern provided as a configuration setting. Events
# are written to files locally and, once file is closed, this plugin uploads
# it to the configured BigQuery dataset.
#
# VERY IMPORTANT:
# 1 - To make good use of BigQuery, your log events should be parsed and
# structured. Consider using grok to parse your events into fields that can
# be uploaded to BQ.
# 2 - You must configure your plugin so it gets events with the same structure,
# so the BigQuery schema suits them. In case you want to upload log events
# with different structures, you can utilize multiple configuration blocks,
# separating different log events with Logstash conditionals. More details on
# Logstash conditionals can be found here:
# http://logstash.net/docs/1.2.1/configuration#conditionals
#
# For more info on Google BigQuery, please go to:
# https://developers.google.com/bigquery/
#
# In order to use this plugin, a Google service account must be used. For
# more information, please refer to:
# https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#service_accounts
#
# Recommendations:

# a - Experiment with the settings depending on how much log data you generate,
# your needs to see "fresh" data, and how much data you could lose in the event
# of crash. For instance, if you want to see recent data in BQ quickly, you
# could configure the plugin to upload data every minute or so (provided you
# have enough log events to justify that). Note also, that if uploads are too
# frequent, there is no guarantee that they will be imported in the same order,
# so later data may be available before earlier data.

# b - BigQuery charges for storage and for queries, depending on how much data
# it reads to perform a query. These are other aspects to consider when
# considering the date pattern which will be used to create new tables and also
# how to compose the queries when using BQ. For more info on BigQuery Pricing,
# please access:
# https://developers.google.com/bigquery/pricing
#
# USAGE:
# This is an example of logstash config:
#
# output {
#    google_bigquery {
#      project_id => "folkloric-guru-278"                        (required)
#      dataset => "logs"                                         (required)
#      csv_schema => "path:STRING,status:INTEGER,score:FLOAT"    (required)
#      key_path => "/path/to/privatekey.p12"                     (required)
#      key_password => "notasecret"                              (optional)
#      service_account => "1234@developer.gserviceaccount.com"   (required)
#      temp_directory => "/tmp/logstash-bq"                      (optional)
#      temp_file_prefix => "logstash_bq"                         (optional)
#      date_pattern => "%Y-%m-%dT%H:00"                          (optional)
#      flush_interval_secs => 2                                  (optional)
#      uploader_interval_secs => 60                              (optional)
#      deleter_interval_secs => 60                               (optional)
#    }
# }
#
# Improvements TODO list:
# - Refactor common code between Google BQ and GCS plugins.
# - Turn Google API code into a Plugin Mixin (like AwsConfig).
# - There's no recover method, so if logstash/plugin crashes, files may not
# be uploaded to BQ.
