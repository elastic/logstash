# A plugin for a newly developed Java/Spring Metrics application
# I didn't really want to code this project but I couldn't find
# a respectable alternative that would also run on any Windows
# machine - which is the problem and why I am not going with Graphite
# and statsd.  This application provides multiple integration options
# so as to make its use under your network requirements possible. 
# This includes a REST option that is always enabled for your use
# in case you want to write a small script to send the occasional 
# metric data.

  # contexts.

  # metrics => { "Response" => "%{response}" }

  #
  # metrics => [ "Response", "%{response}" ]

  # NOTE: you can also use the dynamic fields for the key value as well as the actual value

  # either by graphtastic utility or by this program after connectivity is
  # ensured to be established.
