# This input will read events from a Kafka topic. It uses the high level consumer API provided
# by Kafka to read messages from the broker. It also maintains the state of what has been
# consumed using Zookeeper. The default input codec is json
#
# The only required configuration is the topic name. By default it will connect to a Zookeeper
# running on localhost. All the broker information is read from Zookeeper state
#
# Ideally you should have as many threads as the number of partitions for a perfect balance --
# more threads than partitions means that some threads will be idle

  # Number of threads to read from the partitions. Ideally you should have as many threads as the

  # load to assign partitions to each consumer. If the set of consumers changes while this
  # assignment is taking place the rebalance will fail and retry. This setting controls the
  # maximum number of attempts before giving up.

  config :consumer_id, :validate => :string, :default => nil
  # The number of byes of messages to attempt to fetch for each topic-partition in each fetch
  # request. These bytes will be read into memory for each partition, so this helps control
  # the memory used by the consumer. The fetch request size must be at least as large as the
  # maximum message size the server allows or else it is possible for the producer to send
  # messages larger than the consumer can fetch.
