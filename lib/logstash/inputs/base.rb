  # Types are used mainly for filter activation.
  #
  # If you create an input with type "foobar", then only filters
  # which also have type "foobar" will act on them.
  #
  # The type is also stored as part of the event itself, so you
  # can also use the type to search for in the web interface.
  #
  # If you try to set a type on an event that already has one (for
  # example when you send an event from a shipper to an indexer) then
  # a new input will not override the existing type. A type set at 
  # the shipper stays with that event for its life even
  # when sent to another LogStash server.

  # are expected to be present. Not receiving all fields
