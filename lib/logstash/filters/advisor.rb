# INFORMATION:
# The filter Advisor is designed for capture and confrontation the events. 
# The events must be grep by a filter first, then it can pull out a copy of it, like clone, whit tags "advisor_first",
# this copy is the first occurrence of this event verified in time_adv.
# After time_adv Advisor will pull out an event tagged "advisor_info" who will tell you the number of same events verified in time_adv.

# INFORMATION ABOUT CLASS:
 
# For do this job, i used a thread that will sleep time adv. I assume that events coming on advisor are tagged, then i use an array for storing different events.
# If an events is not present on array, then is the first and if the option is activate then  advisor push out a copy of event.
# Else if the event is present on array, then is another same event and not the first, let's count it.  

# USAGE:

# This is an example of logstash config:

# filter{
#  advisor {
#     time_adv => 1                     #(optional)
#     send_first => true                #(optional)
#  }
# }

# We analize this:

# time_adv => 1
# Means the time when the events matched and collected are pushed on outputs with tag "advisor_info".

# send_first => true
# Means you can push out the first events different who came in advisor like clone copy and tagged with "advisor_first"
