  milestone 1

  # The length of time to sleep, in seconds, for every event.
  #
  # This can be a number (eg, 0.5), or a string (eg, "%{foo}") 
  # The second form (string with a field value) is useful if
  # you have an attribute of your event that you want to use
  # to indicate the amount of time to sleep.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     filter {
  #       sleep {
  #         # Sleep 1 second for every event.
  #         time => "1"
  #       }
  #     }
  config :time, :validate => :string

  # Sleep on every N'th. This option is ignored in replay mode.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     filter {
  #       sleep {
  #         time => "1"   # Sleep 1 second 
  #         every => 10   # on every 10th event
  #       }
  #     }
  config :every, :validate => :string, :default => 1

  # Enable replay mode.
  #
  # Replay mode tries to sleep based on timestamps in each event.
  #
  # The amount of time to sleep is computed by subtracting the
  # previous event's timestamp from the current event's timestamp.
  # This helps you replay events in the same timeline as original.
  #
  # If you specify a `time` setting as well, this filter will
  # use the `time` value as a speed modifier. For example,
  # a `time` value of 2 will replay at double speed, while a
  # value of 0.25 will replay at 1/4th speed.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #     filter {
  #       sleep {
  #         time => 2
  #         replay => true
  #       }
  #     }
  #
  # The above will sleep in such a way that it will perform
  # replay 2-times faster than the original time speed.
