# This filter will collapse multiline messages from a single source into one Logstash event.
#
# The original goal of this filter was to allow joining of multi-line messages
# from files into a single event. For example - joining java exception and
# stacktrace messages into a single event.
#
# NOTE: This filter will not work with multiple worker threads "-w 2" on the logstash command line.
#
# The config looks like this:
#
#     filter {
#       multiline {
#         type => "type"
#         pattern => "pattern, a regexp"
#         negate => boolean
#         what => "previous" or "next"
#       }
#     }
#
# The `pattern` should be a regexp which matches what you believe to be an indicator
# that the field is part of an event consisting of multiple lines of log data.
#
# The `what` must be "previous" or "next" and indicates the relation
# to the multi-line event.
#
# The `negate` can be "true" or "false" (defaults to false). If "true", a
# message not matching the pattern will constitute a match of the multiline
# filter and the `what` will be applied. (vice-versa is also true)
#
# For example, Java stack traces are multiline and usually have the message
# starting at the far-left, with each subsequent line indented. Do this:
#
#     filter {
#       multiline {
#         type => "somefiletype"
#         pattern => "^\s"
#         what => "previous"
#       }
#     }
#
# This says that any line starting with whitespace belongs to the previous line.
#
# Another example is C line continuations (backslash). Here's how to do that:
#
#     filter {
#       multiline {
#         type => "somefiletype "
#         pattern => "\\$"
#         what => "next"
#       }
#     }
#
# This says that any line ending with a backslash should be combined with the
# following line.

  # The stream identity is how the multiline filter determines which stream an
  # event belongs to. This is generally used for differentiating, say, events
  # coming from multiple files in the same file input, or multiple connections
  # coming from a tcp input.
  #
  # The default value here is usually what you want, but there are some cases
  # where you want to change it. One such example is if you are using a tcp
  # input with only one client connecting at any time. If that client
  # reconnects (due to error or client restart), then logstash will identify
  # the new connection as a new stream and break any multiline goodness that
  # may have occurred between the old and new connection. To solve this use
  # case, you can use "%{@source_host}.%{@type}" instead.

  # Logstash ships by default with a bunch of patterns, so you don't
