# multiline filter
#
# This filter will collapse multiline messages into a single event.
# 

require "logstash/filters/base"
require "logstash/namespace"

# The multiline filter is for combining multiple events from a single source
# into the same event.
#
# The original goal of this filter was to allow joining of multi-line messages
# from files into a single event. For example - joining java exception and
# stacktrace messages into a single event.
#
# TODO(sissel): Document any issues?
# The config looks like this:
#
#     filter {
#       multiline {
#         type => "type"
#         pattern => "pattern, a regexp"
#         negate => boolean
#         what => "previous" or "next"
#       }
#     }
# 
# The 'regexp' should match what you believe to be an indicator that
# the field is part of a multi-line event
#
# The 'what' must be "previous" or "next" and indicates the relation
# to the multi-line event.
#
# The 'negate' can be "true" or "false" (defaults false). If true, a 
# message not matching the pattern will constitute a match of the multiline
# filter and the what will be applied. (vice-versa is also true)
#
# For example, java stack traces are multiline and usually have the message
# starting at the far-left, then each subsequent line indented. Do this:
# 
#     filter {
#       multiline {
#         type => "somefiletype"
#         pattern => "^\s"
#         what => "previous"
#       }
#     }
#     
# This says that any line starting with whitespace belongs to the previous line.
#
# Another example is C line continuations (backslash). Here's how to do that:
#
#     filter {
#       multiline {
#         type => "somefiletype "
#         pattern => "\\$"
#         what => "next"
#       }
#     }
#

  # The stream identity is how the multiline filter determines which stream an
  # event belongs. This is generally used for differentiating, say, events
  # coming from multiple files in the same file input, or multiple connections
  # coming from a tcp input.
  #
  # The default value here is usually what you want, but there are some cases
  # where you want to change it. One such example is if you are using a tcp
  # input with only one client connecting at any time. If that client
  # reconnects (due to error or client restart), then logstash will identify
  # the new connection as a new stream and break any multiline goodness that
  # may have occurred between the old and new connection. To solve this use
  # case, you can use "%{@source_host}.%{@type}" instead.
