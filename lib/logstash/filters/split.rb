# The split filter is for splitting multiline messages into separate events.
#
# An example use case of this filter is for taking output from the 'exec' input
# which emits one event for the whole output of a command and splitting that
# output by newline - making each line an event.
#
# The end result of each split is a complete copy of the event 
# with only the current split section of the given field changed.
