# Originally written to translate HTTP response codes 
# but turned into a general translation tool which uses
# configured has or/and .yaml files as a dictionary.
# response codes in default dictionary were scraped from 
# 'gem install cheat; cheat status_codes'
#
# Alternatively for simple string search and replacements for just a few values
# use the gsub function of the mutate filter.
