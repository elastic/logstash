# ZeroMQ filter. This is the best way to send an event externally for filtering
# It works much like an exec filter would by sending the event "offsite"
# for processing and waiting for a response
#
# The protocol here is:
#   * REQ sent with JSON-serialized logstash event
#   * REP read expected to be the full JSON 'filtered' event
#   * - if reply read is an empty string, it will cancel the event.
#
# Note that this is a limited subset of the zeromq functionality in
# inputs and outputs. The only topology that makes sense here is:
# REQ/REP.

  # ZMQ::SWAP_SIZE - space for disk overflow
  # ZMQ::SUBSCRIBE - topic filters for pubsub

  # example: sockopt => ["ZMQ::HWM", 50, "ZMQ::IDENTITY", "my_named_queue"]
