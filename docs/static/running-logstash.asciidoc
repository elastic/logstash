=== Running Logstash as a Service on Debian or RPM

Logstash is not started automatically after installation. How to start and stop Logstash depends on whether your system
uses systemd, upstart, or SysV.

Here are some common operating systems and versions, and the corresponding
startup styles they use.  This list is intended to be informative, not exhaustive.

[[running-logstash-systemd]]
==== Running Logstash by Using Systemd

Distributions like Debian Jessie, Ubuntu 15.10+, and many of the SUSE derivatives use systemd and the
`systemctl` command to start and stop services. Logstash places the systemd unit files in `/etc/systemd/system` for both deb and rpm. After installing the package, you can start up Logstash with:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo systemctl start logstash.service
-------------------------------------------

[[running-logstash-upstart]]
==== Running Logstash by Using Upstart

For systems that use upstart, you can start Logstash with:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo initctl start logstash
-------------------------------------------

The auto-generated configuration file for upstart systems is `/etc/init/logstash.conf`.

[[running-logstash-sysv]]
==== Running Logstash by Using SysV

For systems that use SysV, you can start Logstash with:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/logstash start
-------------------------------------------

The auto-generated configuration file for SysV systems is `/etc/init.d/logstash`.
