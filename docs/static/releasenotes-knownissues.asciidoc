==== Known issue

**TLS v1.3 with Docker images 7.2.0 - 7.4.1**

Bugs in some JDK versions can prevent {ls} from successfully conducting a TLS
v1.3 handshake. This issue impacts:

* {ls} Docker images 7.2.0 - 7.4.1 when you use TLS v1.3.

If you encounter this issue, we recommend upgrading to {ls} Docker images 7.4.2
or later. If you cannot upgrade, try using and enforcing TLS v1.2.
