=== Command-line flags

Logstash has the following flags. You can use the `--help` flag to display this information.

[source,shell]
----------------------------------
-f, --path.config CONFIGFILE
 Load the Logstash config from a specific file, directory, or a wildcard. If
 given a directory or wildcard, config files will be read from the directory in
 alphabetical order.

-e, --config.string CONFIGSTRING
 Use the given string as the configuration data. Same syntax as the config file.
 If not input is specified, 'stdin { type => stdin }' is default. If no output
 is specified, 'stdout { codec => rubydebug }}' is default.

-w, --pipeline.workers COUNT
 Sets the number of pipeline workers (threads) to run for filter processing (default: number of cores).
 If you find that events are backing up, or that the CPU is not saturated, consider increasing
 this number to better utilize machine processing power.

-b, --pipeline.batch.size SIZE
 This parameter defines the maximum number of events an individual worker thread will collect
 before attempting to execute its filters and outputs. Default is 125 events.
 Larger batch sizes are generally more efficient, but come at the cost of increased memory
 overhead. You may have to increase the JVM heap size by setting the `LS_HEAP_SIZE`
 variable to effectively use the option.

-u, --pipeline.batch.delay DELAY_IN_MS
 When creating pipeline event batches, how long to wait while polling for the next event.
 Default is 5ms.

-l, --path.log FILE
 Log to a given path. Default is to log to stdout

--log.level
 Set the log level, between "quiet", "verbose", "warn" (default) and "debug".

--log.format FORMAT
 Set to "json" to log in JSON format, or "plain" (default) to use Object#.inspect

--config.debug
 Print the compiled config ruby code out as a debug log (you must also have --log.level=debug enabled).
 WARNING: This will include any 'password' options passed to plugin configs as plaintext, and may result
 in plaintext passwords appearing in your logs!

-V, --version
  Display the version of Logstash.

-p, --path.plugins
  A path of where to find plugins. This flag can be given multiple times to include
  multiple paths. Plugins are expected to be in a specific directory hierarchy:
  'PATH/logstash/TYPE/NAME.rb' where TYPE is 'inputs' 'filters', 'outputs' or 'codecs'
  and NAME is the name of the plugin.

-t, --config.test_and_exit
  Checks configuration and then exit. Note that grok patterns are not checked for
  correctness with this flag.
  Logstash can read multiple config files from a directory. If you combine this
  flag with `--log.level=debug`, Logstash will log the combined config file, annotating the
  individual config blocks with the source file it came from.
  
-r, --config.reload.automatic
  Monitor configuration changes and reload the configuration whenever it is changed.

--config.reload.interval RELOAD_INTERVAL
  Specifies how often Logstash checks the config files for changes. The default is every 3 seconds.

--http.host HTTP_HOST
  Web API binding host (default: "127.0.0.1")

--http.port HTTP_PORT
  Web API http port (default: 9600)

--pipeline.unsafe_shutdown
  Force logstash to exit during shutdown even if there are still inflight events
  in memory. By default, logstash will refuse to quit until all received events
  have been pushed to the outputs.

-h, --help
  Print help
