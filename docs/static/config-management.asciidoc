== Managing {ls}

{ls} provides configuration management features to make it easier for you to
manage updates to your configuration over time.

The topics in this section describe {ls} configuration management features
only. For information about other config management tools, such as Puppet and
Chef, see the documentation for those projects. Also take a look at the
https://forge.puppet.com/elastic/logstash[{ls} Puppet module documentation].
