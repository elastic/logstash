== Configuration Management

Logstash provides configuration management features to make it easier for you to
manage updates to your configuration over time.

The topics in this section describe Logstash configuration management features
only. For information about other config management tools, such as Puppet and
Chef, see the documentation for those projects. Also take a look at the
https://forge.puppet.com/elastic/logstash[Logstash Puppet module documentation].
