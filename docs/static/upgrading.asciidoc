== Upgrading Logstash

[IMPORTANT]
===========================================
Before upgrading Logstash:

* Consult the <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>> docs.
* Test upgrades in a development environment before upgrading your production cluster.
===========================================

If you are installing Logstash with other components in the Elastic Stack, also see the
{stack-ref}/index.html[Elastic Stack installation and upgrade documentation].

See the following topics for information about upgrading Logstash:

* <<upgrading-using-package-managers>>
* <<upgrading-using-direct-download>>
* <<upgrading-logstash-5.0>>
* <<upgrading-logstash-pqs>>

[[upgrading-using-package-managers]]
=== Upgrading Using Package Managers

This procedure uses <<package-repositories,package managers>> to upgrade Logstash.

1. Shut down your Logstash pipeline, including any inputs that send events to Logstash.
2. Using the directions in the _Package Repositories_ section, update your repository links to point to the 5.x repositories
instead of the previous version.
3. Run the `apt-get upgrade logstash` or `yum update logstash` command as appropriate for your operating system.
4. Test your configuration file with the `logstash --config.test_and_exit -f <configuration-file>` command. Configuration options for
some Logstash plugins have changed in the 5.x release.
5. Restart your Logstash pipeline after updating your configuration file.

[[upgrading-using-direct-download]]
=== Upgrading Using a Direct Download

This procedure downloads the relevant Logstash binaries directly from Elastic.

1. Shut down your Logstash pipeline, including any inputs that send events to Logstash.
2. Download the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash[Logstash installation file] that matches your host environment.
3. Unpack the installation file into your Logstash directory.
4. Test your configuration file with the `logstash --config.test_and_exit -f <configuration-file>` command. Configuration options for
some Logstash plugins have changed in the 5.x release.
5. Restart your Logstash pipeline after updating your configuration file.

[[upgrading-logstash-5.0]]
=== Upgrading Logstash to 5.0

Before upgrading Logstash, remember to read the <<breaking-changes,breaking changes>>.

If you are installing Logstash with other components in the Elastic Stack, also see the
{stack-ref}/index.html[Elastic Stack installation and upgrade documentation].

==== When to Upgrade

Fresh installations can and should start with the same version across the Elastic Stack.

Elasticsearch 5.0 does not require Logstash 5.0. An Elasticsearch 5.0 cluster will happily receive data from a
Logstash 2.x instance via the default HTTP communication layer. This provides some flexibility to decide when to upgrade
Logstash relative to an Elasticsearch upgrade. It may or may not be convenient for you to upgrade them together, and it
is
not required to be done at the same time as long as Elasticsearch is upgraded first.

You should upgrade in a timely manner to get the performance improvements that come with Logstash 5.0, but do so in
the way that makes the most sense for your environment.

==== When Not to Upgrade

If any Logstash plugin that you require is not compatible with Logstash 5.0, then you should wait until it is ready
before upgrading.

Although we make great efforts to ensure compatibility, Logstash 5.0 is not completely backwards compatible. As noted
in the Elastic Stack upgrade guide, Logstash 5.0 should not be upgraded before Elasticsearch 5.0. This is both
practical and because some Logstash 5.0 plugins may attempt to use features of Elasticsearch 5.0 that did not exist
in earlier versions. For example, if you attempt to send the 5.x template to a cluster before Elasticsearch 5.0, then it
will not be able to use it and all indexing will fail likely fail. If you use your own, custom template with Logstash,
then this issue can be ignored.

Note the Elasticsearch Output Index Template change in the <<breaking-changes>> documentation for further insight into
this change and how it impacts operations.

[[upgrading-logstash-pqs]]
=== Upgrading with the Persistent Queue Enabled

The following applies only if you are upgrading Logstash and have the persistent
queue enabled.

[[drain-pq]]
==== Drain the Persistent Queue

If you use the persistent queue, we strongly recommend that you drain or delete
it before you upgrade.

To drain the queue:
 
. In the logstash.yml file, set `queue.drain:true`.
. Restart Logstash for this setting to take effect. 
. Shutdown Logstash (using CTRL+C or SIGTERM), and wait for the queue to empty.

When the queue is empty:

. Complete the upgrade.
. Restart Logstash.

We are working to resolve issues with data incompatibilities so that these steps
wonâ€™t be required for future upgrades.
