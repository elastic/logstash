=== Logstash ArcSight Module

++++
<titleabbrev>ArcSight Module</titleabbrev>
++++

NOTE: The Logstash ArcSight module is an
https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack[X-Pack] feature under the Basic License
and is therefore free to use. Please contact
mailto:arcsight@elastic.co[arcsight@elastic.co] for questions or more
information.

The Logstash ArcSight module enables you to easily integrate with and augment
the ArcSight Data Platform (ADP) to explore your data in Elasticsearch using
Kibana visualizations. With a single command, the module taps directly into the
ADP data stream, parses and indexes the security events into Elasticsearch, and
installs a suite of Kibana dashboards to get you exploring your data
immediately.

[[arcsight-architecture]]
==== Deployment Architecture

The Logstash ArcSight module understands CEF (Common Event Format), and can
accept, enrich, and index these events for analysis on the Elastic Stack. ADP
contains two core data collection components for data streaming:

* The _Event Broker (EB)_ is the central hub for incoming data and is based on
open source Apache Kafka. The Logstash ArcSight module can consume directly from
EB topics.
* The _Smart Connectors (SC)_ are edge log collectors that parse and normalize
data to CEF prior to publishing to the EB.

[[arcsight-getting-started]]
==== Getting Started

To get started, you can use a basic Elastic Stack setup that reads events from
the EB event stream.

[[arcsight-requirements]]
===== Requirements

* These instructions assume you have the Elastic Stack (Logstash, Elasticsearch,
Kibana) already installed. The products you need are
https://www.elastic.co/downloads[available to download] and easy to install. The
Elastic Stack 5.6 or higher is required for this module.
* The Elastic Stack is running locally with default ports exposed, namely
Elasticsearch as “localhost:9200” and Kibana as “localhost:5601”.
* By default, the Logstash ArcSight module consumes from the EB “eb-cef” topic.
For additional EB settings, see <<arcsight-module-config>>. Consuming from a
secured EB port is not currently available.

===== Instructions

. {ref}/installing-xpack-es.html[Install X-Pack on Elasticsearch] and then start
Elasticsearch.

. {kibana-ref}/installing-xpack-kb.html[Install X-Pack on Kibana] and then start
Kibana.

. {logstash-ref}/installing-xpack-log.html[Install X-Pack on Logstash], which
includes the Logstash ArcSight module. Then update the Logstash
<<plugins-inputs-kafka,Kafka input plugin>> to an EB compatible version. In the
Logstash install directory, run:
+
[source,shell]
-----
bin/logstash-plugin install x-pack
bin/logstash-plugin install --version 6.2.7 logstash-input-kafka
-----

. Start the Logstash ArcSight module by running the following command in the
Logstash install directory with your respective EB host and port:
+
[source,shell]
-----
bin/logstash --modules arcsight --setup
  -M "arcsight.var.input.eventbroker.bootstrap_servers={eb_host}:{eb_port}" 
  -M "arcsight.var.elasticsearch.username=elastic" 
  -M "arcsight.var.elasticsearch.password=changeme" 
  -M "arcsight.var.kibana.username=elastic" 
  -M "arcsight.var.kibana.password=changeme"
-----
+
--
TIP: The command in this example is formatted for readability. Remove the line
breaks before running this command.

The `--modules arcsight` option spins up an ArcSight CEF-aware Logstash
pipeline for ingestion. The `--setup` option creates an `arcsight-*` index
pattern in Elasticsearch and imports Kibana dashboards and visualizations. On
subsequent module runs or when scaling out the Logstash deployment,
the `--setup` option should be omitted to avoid overwriting the existing Kibana
dashboards.
--

. Explore your data with Kibana:
.. Open browser @ http://localhost:5601[http://localhost:5601] (username:
  “elastic”; password: “changeme”)
.. Open the “[ArcSight] Network Overview Dashboard”
.. See <<exploring-data-arcsight>> for additional details on data exploration.

See <<configuring-arcsight>> if you want to specify additional options that
control the behavior of the ArcSight module.

[[exploring-data-arcsight]]
==== Exploring Your Security Data
Once the Logstash ArcSight module starts receiving events, you can immediately
begin using the packaged Kibana dashboards to explore and visualize your
security data. The dashboards rapidly accelerate the time and effort required
for security analysts and operators to gain situational and behavioral insights
on network, endpoint, and DNS events flowing through the environment. You can
use the dashboards as-is, or tailor them to work better with existing use cases
and business requirements.

The dashboards have a navigation pane for context switching and drill downs
across three core use cases:

* *Network Data*
** Dashboards: Network Overview, Network Suspicious Activity
** Data Types: Network firewalls, intrusion systems, VPN devices

* *Endpoint Data*
** Dashboards: Endpoint Overview, Endpoint OS Activity
** Data Types: Operating systems, applications, host intrusion systems

* *DNS Data*
** Dashboards: Microsoft DNS Overview
** Data Types: Microsoft DNS devices

===== Example Network Dashboards

These Kibana visualizations enable you to quickly understand the top devices,
endpoints, attackers, and targets. This insight, along with the ability to
instantly drill down on a particular host, port, device, or time range, offers a
holistic view across the entire environment to identify specific segments that
may require immediate attention or action. You can easily discover answers to
questions like:

* Who are my attackers and what are they targeting?
* Which of my devices or endpoints are the busiest and what services were
rendered?
* How many unique attackers, techniques, signatures, or targets were triggered
at any given point in time?
* What are the top sources, destinations, protocols, and behaviors that are
causing the elevated count of failures?

[[configuring-arcsight]]
==== Configuring the Module

You can specify additional options for the Logstash ArcSight module in the
`logstash.yml` configuration file or with overrides through the command line
like in the getting started. For more information about configuring modules, see
<<logstash-modules>>.

As an example, the following settings can be appended to `logstash.yml` to
configure your module:

[source,yaml]
-----
modules:
  - name: arcsight
    var.input.eventbroker.bootstrap_servers: “eb_host:39092”
    var.input.eventbroker.topics: “eb_topic”
    var.elasticsearch.hosts: "localhost:9200"
    var.elasticsearch.username: "elastic"
    var.elasticsearch.password: "changeme"
    var.kibana.host: “localhost:5601”
    var.kibana.username: "elastic"
    var.kibana.password: "changeme"
-----

[[arcsight-module-config]]
===== Logstash ArcSight Module Configuration Options

These are the configurable settings available for the Logstash ArcSight module.
When overriding settings in the command line, the setting option must be
prefixed with the module name, i.e. `arcsight.var.inputs` instead of `var.inputs`.

All settings are optional. If you don't specify configuration settings, Logstash
uses the defaults.

*`var.inputs`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is “eventbroker”
--
+
Set the input(s) to expose for the Logstash ArcSight module. Valid settings are
“eventbroker”, “smartconnector”, or “eventbroker,smartconnector” (exposes both
  inputs concurrently).

*`var.input.eventbroker.bootstrap_servers`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is “localhost:39092”
--
+
A list of EB URLs to use for establishing the initial connection to the cluster.
This list should be in the form of `host1:port1,host2:port2`. These URLs are
just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership
(which may change dynamically), so this list need not contain the full set of
servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

*`var.input.eventbroker.topics`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<array,array>>
* Default value is [“eb-cef”]
--
+
A list of EB topics to subscribe to.

*`var.input.smartconnector.port`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<number,number>>
* Default value is 5000
--
+
The TCP port to listen on when receiving data from SCs.

*`var.elasticsearch.hosts`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<uri,uri>>
* Default value is “localhost:9200”
--
+
Sets the host(s) of the Elasticsearch cluster. If given an <<array,array>> it
will load balance requests across the hosts specified in the hosts parameter. It
is important to exclude {ref}/modules-node.html[dedicated master nodes] from the
hosts list to prevent Logstash from sending bulk requests to the master nodes.
So this parameter should only reference either data or client nodes in
Elasticsearch.
+
Any special characters present in the URLs here MUST be URL escaped! This means #
should be put in as %23 for instance.

*`var.elasticsearch.username`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is “elastic”
--
+
The username to authenticate to a secure Elasticsearch cluster.

*`var.elasticsearch.password`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is “changeme”
--
+
The password to authenticate to a secure Elasticsearch cluster.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.enabled`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
--
+
Enable SSL/TLS secured communication to the Elasticsearch cluster. Leaving this
unspecified will use whatever scheme is specified in the URLs listed in `hosts`.
If no explicit protocol is specified, plain HTTP will be used. If SSL is
explicitly disabled here, the plugin will refuse to start if an HTTPS URL is
given in hosts.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.verification_mode`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "strict"
--
+
The hostname verification setting when communicating with Elasticsearch. Set to
`disable` to turn off hostname verification. Disabling this has serious security
concerns.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate_authority`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to an X.509 certificate to use to validate SSL certificates when
communicating with Kibana.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to an X.509 certificate to use for client authentication when
communicating with Elasticsearch.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.key`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to the certificate key for client authentication when communicating
with Elasticsearch.

*`var.kibana.host`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is “localhost:5601”
--
+
Sets the host of the Kibana instance to import dashboards and visualizations.

*`var.kibana.username`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is “elastic”
--
+
The username to authenticate to a secured Kibana instance.

*`var.kibana.password`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is “changeme”
--
+
The password to authenticate to a secure Kibana instance.

*`var.kibana.ssl.enabled`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
* Default value is false
--
+
Enable SSL/TLS secured communication to the Kibana instance.

*`var.kibana.ssl.verification_mode`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "strict"
--
+
The hostname verification setting when communicating with Kibana. Set to
`disable` to turn off hostname verification. Disabling this has serious security
concerns.

*`var.kibana.ssl.certificate_authority`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to an X.509 certificate to use to validate SSL certificates when
communicating with Kibana.

*`var.kibana.ssl.certificate`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to an X.509 certificate to use for client authentication when
communicating with Kibana.

*`var.kibana.ssl.key`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to the certificate key for client authentication when communicating
with Kibana.
