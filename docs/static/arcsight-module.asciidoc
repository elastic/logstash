=== Logstash ArcSight Module

++++
<titleabbrev>ArcSight Module</titleabbrev>
++++

NOTE: The Logstash ArcSight module is an
https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack[X-Pack] feature under the Basic License
and is therefore free to use. Please contact
mailto:arcsight@elastic.co[arcsight@elastic.co] for questions or more
information.

The Logstash ArcSight module enables you to easily integrate your ArcSight data with the Elastic Stack. 
With a single command, the module taps directly into the ArcSight Smart Connector or the Event Broker, 
parses and indexes the security events into Elasticsearch, and installs a suite of Kibana dashboards 
to get you exploring your data immediately. 

[[arcsight-architecture]]
==== Deployment Architecture

The Logstash ArcSight module understands CEF (Common Event Format), and can
accept, enrich, and index these events for analysis on the Elastic Stack. ADP
contains two core data collection components for data streaming:

* The _Smart Connectors (SC)_ are edge log collectors that parse and normalize
data to CEF prior to publishing to the Logstash receiver.
* The _Event Broker (EB)_ is the central hub for incoming data and is based on
open source Apache Kafka. The Logstash ArcSight module can consume directly from
EB topics.

[[arcsight-getting-started-smartconnector]]
==== Getting Started With The Smart Connector

To get started, you can use a basic Elastic Stack setup that reads events from
the Smart Connector directly.

[[arcsight-requirements-smartconnector]]
===== Requirements

* These instructions assume you have part of the Elastic Stack (Logstash, Elasticsearch,
Kibana) already installed. The products you need are
https://www.elastic.co/downloads[available to download] and easy to install. The
Elastic Stack 5.6 or higher is required for this module.
* The Elastic Stack is running locally with default ports exposed, namely
Elasticsearch as "localhost:9200" and Kibana as "localhost:5601". Note that you can also run 
Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash on separate hosts to consume data from ArcSight.
* Smart Connector has been configured to publish ArcSight data (to TCP port `5000`) using the CEF syslog 
destination.

TIP: The command in this example is formatted for readability. Remove the line
breaks before running this command.

The `--modules arcsight` option spins up an ArcSight CEF-aware Logstash
pipeline for ingestion. The `--setup` option creates an `arcsight-*` index
pattern in Elasticsearch and imports Kibana dashboards and visualizations. On
subsequent module runs or when scaling out the Logstash deployment,
the `--setup` option should be omitted to avoid overwriting the existing Kibana
dashboards.

. Explore your data with Kibana:
.. Open browser @ http://localhost:5601[http://localhost:5601] (username:
  "elastic"; password: "{pwd}")
.. Open the *[ArcSight] Network Overview Dashboard*
.. See <<exploring-data-arcsight>> for additional details on data exploration.

See <<configuring-arcsight>> if you want to specify additional options that

==== Getting Started With The Event Broker

To get started, you can use a basic Elastic Stack setup that reads events from
the EB event stream.

* By default, the Logstash ArcSight module consumes from the EB "eb-cef" topic.
For additional EB settings, see <<arcsight-module-config>>. Consuming from a
secured EB port is not currently available.

[[exploring-data-arcsight]]
==== Exploring Your Security Data
Once the Logstash ArcSight module starts receiving events, you can immediately
begin using the packaged Kibana dashboards to explore and visualize your
security data. The dashboards rapidly accelerate the time and effort required
for security analysts and operators to gain situational and behavioral insights
on network, endpoint, and DNS events flowing through the environment. You can
use the dashboards as-is, or tailor them to work better with existing use cases
and business requirements.

The dashboards have a navigation pane for context switching and drill downs
across three core use cases:

* *Network Data*
** Dashboards: Network Overview, Network Suspicious Activity
** Data Types: Network firewalls, intrusion systems, VPN devices

* *Endpoint Data*
** Dashboards: Endpoint Overview, Endpoint OS Activity
** Data Types: Operating systems, applications, host intrusion systems

* *DNS Data*
** Dashboards: Microsoft DNS Overview
** Data Types: Microsoft DNS devices

===== Example Network Dashboards

image::static/images/arcsight-network-overview.png[Network overview dashboard]

[role="screenshot"]
image::static/images/arcsight-network-suspicious.png[Network suspicious activity dashboard]

These Kibana visualizations enable you to quickly understand the top devices,
endpoints, attackers, and targets. This insight, along with the ability to
instantly drill down on a particular host, port, device, or time range, offers a
holistic view across the entire environment to identify specific segments that
may require immediate attention or action. You can easily discover answers to
questions like:

* Who are my attackers and what are they targeting?
* Which of my devices or endpoints are the busiest and what services were
rendered?
* How many unique attackers, techniques, signatures, or targets were triggered
at any given point in time?
* What are the top sources, destinations, protocols, and behaviors that are
causing the elevated count of failures?

[[configuring-arcsight]]
==== Configuring the Module

You can specify additional options for the Logstash ArcSight module in the
`logstash.yml` configuration file or with overrides through the command line
like in the getting started. For more information about configuring modules, see
<<logstash-modules>>.

As an example, the following settings can be appended to `logstash.yml` to
configure your module:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes"] 
-----
modules:
  - name: arcsight
    var.input.eventbroker.bootstrap_servers: "eb_host:39092"
    var.input.eventbroker.topics: "eb_topic"
    var.elasticsearch.hosts: "localhost:9200"
    var.elasticsearch.username: "elastic"
    var.elasticsearch.password: "{pwd}"
    var.kibana.host: “localhost:5601”
    var.kibana.username: "elastic"
    var.kibana.password: "{pwd}"
-----

[[arcsight-module-config]]
===== Logstash ArcSight Module Configuration Options

The ArcSight module provides the following settings for configuring the behavior
of the module. These settings include ArcSight-specific options plus common
options that are supported by all Logstash modules. 

When you override a setting at the command line, remember to prefix the setting
with the module name, for example, `arcsight.var.inputs` instead of `var.inputs`.

If you don't specify configuration settings, Logstash uses the defaults.

*ArcSight Module Options*

*`var.inputs`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "eventbroker"
--
+
Set the input(s) to expose for the Logstash ArcSight module. Valid settings are
"eventbroker", "smartconnector", or "eventbroker,smartconnector" (exposes both
inputs concurrently).

*`var.input.eventbroker.bootstrap_servers`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "localhost:39092"
--
+
A list of EB URLs to use for establishing the initial connection to the cluster.
This list should be in the form of `host1:port1,host2:port2`. These URLs are
just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership
(which may change dynamically), so this list need not contain the full set of
servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).

*`var.input.eventbroker.topics`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<array,array>>
* Default value is ["eb-cef"]
--
+
A list of EB topics to subscribe to.

*`var.input.smartconnector.port`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<number,number>>
* Default value is 5000
--
+
The TCP port to listen on when receiving data from SCs.
