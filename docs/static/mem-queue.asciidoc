=== Memory queue

By default, Logstash uses in-memory bounded queues between pipeline stages
(inputs â†’ pipeline workers) to buffer events. The size of these in-memory
queues is fixed and not configurable. If Logstash experiences a temporary
machine failure, the contents of the in-memory queue will be lost. Temporary machine
failures are scenarios where Logstash or its host machine are terminated
abnormally but are capable of being restarted.
