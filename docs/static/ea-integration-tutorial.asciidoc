=== Tutorial: {ls} `elastic_integration filter` to extend Elastic {integrations}
++++
<titleabbrev>Tutorial: {ls} `elastic_integration filter`</titleabbrev>
++++

You can use {ls} to transform events collected by {agent} using our {integrations-docs}[Elastic integrations]. 
You get the benefits of Elastic integrations--such as the simplicity of ingesting data from a wide variety of data 
sources and ensuring compliance with the {ecs-ref}/index.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]--combined with the extra 
processing power of {ls}. 

This new functionality is made possible by the <<plugins-filters-elastic_integration,elastic_integration filter>> plugin.
When you include the `elastic_integration` filter in your configuration, {ls} reads certain field values generated by the {agent}, 
and uses them to apply the transformations from Elastic integrations to further process events before sending them to their 
configured destinations.

This tutorial walks you through adding the {integrations-docs}/crowdstrike-intro[Crowdstrike integration], using {ls} to 
remove the `_version` field, and then sending the data to {ess} or self-managed {es}. 


[[ea-integrations-prereqs]]
==== Prerequisites and requirements 

You'll need:

* A working {es} cluster
* {fleet} server
* An {agent} configured to send output to {ls}
* An active Elastic Enterprise https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription]
* A user configured with the <<plugins-filters-elastic_integration-minimum_required_privileges,minimum required privileges>>

NOTE: Even though the focus of this tutorial is {Fleet}-managed agents, you can use the `elastic_integration` filter and this 
general approach with {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-configuration.html[self-managed agents].

[[ea-integrations-fleet]]
=== Configure {fleet} to send data from {agent} to {ls}

. For {fleet}-managed agents, go to {kib} and navigate to *Fleet > Settings*.

. Create a new output and specify {ls} as the output type.

. Add the {ls} hosts (domain or IP address/s) that the {agent} should send data to.

. Add the client SSL certificate and the Client SSL certificate key to the configuration.

. Click *Save and apply settings* in the bottom right-hand corner of the page.

[discrete]
[[ea-integrations-create-policy]]
=== Create an {agent} policy with the necessary integrations

. In {kib} navigate to *Fleet > Agent* policies, and select *Create agent policy*.

. Give this policy a name, and then select *Advanced options*.

. Change the *Output for integrations* setting to the {ls} output you created.

. Click *Create agent policy*. 

. Select the policy name, and click *Add integration*. 
+ 
This step takes you to the integrations browser, where you can select an integration that has everything 
necessary to _integrate_ the data source with your other data in the {stack}.
We'll use Crowdstrike as our example in this tutorial.

. On the *Crowdstrike* integration overview page, click *Add Crowdstrike* to configure the integration.

. Configure the integration to collect the data you need.
On step 2 at the bottom of the page (*Where to add this integration?*), make sure that the “Existing hosts” option
is selected and the Agent policy selected is the Logstash policy we created for our Logstash output. 
This policy should be selected by default.

. Click *Save and continue*.
+
You have the option to add the {agent} to your hosts. 
If you haven't already, {fleet-guide}/elastic-agent-installation.html[install the {agent}] on the host where you want to collect data.

[[ea-integrations-pipeline]]
=== Configure {ls} to use the `elastic_integration` filter plugin

. Create a new {logstash-ref}/configuration.html[{ls} pipeline].
. Be sure to include these plugins:

*  <<plugins-inputs-elastic_agent,`elastic_agent` input>>
*  <<plugins-filters-elastic_integration,`elastic_integration` filter>>
*  <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,`elasticsearch` output>>

Note that every event sent from the {agent} to {ls} contains specific meta-fields. 
{ls} expects events to contain `data_stream.type`, `data_stream.dataset`, and `data_stream.namespace`.

{ls} uses this information and its connection to {es} to determine which integrations to apply to the event before sending the event to its destination output.
{ls} frequently synchronizes with {es} to ensure that it has the most recent versions of the enabled integrations.

[[ea-integrations-ess-sample]]
==== Sample configuration: output to {ess}

This sample illustrates using the `elastic_agent` input and the `elastic_integration` filter for processing in {ls}, and then sending the output to {ess}.

Check out the <<plugins-filters-elastic_integration,elastic_integration filter plugin docs>> for the full list of configuration options.

[source,txt]
-----
input {
 elastic_agent { port => 5055 }
}

filter {
 elastic_integration {
  cloud_id => "your-cloud:id"
  api_key => "api-key"
  remove_field => ["_version"]
 }
}

output {
 stdout {}
 elasticsearch {
  cloud_auth => "elastic:<pwd>"
  cloud_id => "your-cloud-id"
  }
 }
-----

All processing occurs in {ls} before events are forwarded to {ess}.

[[ea-integrations-es-sample]]
==== Sample configuration: output to self-managed {es}

This sample illustrates using the `elastic_agent` input and the `elastic_integration` filter for processing in {ls}, and then sending the output to {es}.
