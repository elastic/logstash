=== Setting the heap size

Set the jvm heap size in the `jvm.options` <<config-setting-files,configuration
file>>.

NOTE: The recommended heap size for typical ingestion scenarios should be no
less than 4GB and no more than 8GB.

Here are some additional tips for adjusting the JVM heap size:

* CPU utilization can increase unnecessarily if the heap size is too low,
resulting in the JVM constantly garbage collecting. You can check for this issue
by doubling the heap size to see if performance improves. 

* Do not increase the heap size past the amount of physical
memory. Leave at least 1GB free for the OS and other processes.

* Set the minimum (Xms) and maximum (Xmx) heap allocation size to the same
value to prevent the heap from resizing at runtime, which is a very costly
process.

* You can make more accurate measurements of the JVM heap by using either the
`jmap` command line utility distributed with Java or by using VisualVM. For more
info, see <<profiling-the-heap>>.
