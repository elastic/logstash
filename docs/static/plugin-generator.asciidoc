=== Generating Plugins

You can now create your own Logstash plugin in seconds! The generate subcommand
of `bin/logstash-plugin` creates the foundation  for a new Logstash plugin with
template files. It creates the correct directory structure, gemspec files,
and dependencies so you can start adding custom code to process data with
Logstash.
