=== Publish your plugin to RubyGems.org

Logstash uses http://rubygems.org[RubyGems.org] as its repository for all plugin artifacts. 
After you have developed your new plugin, you can make it available to
Logstash users by publishing it to RubyGems.org.

==== Licensing
Logstash and all its plugins are licensed under
https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/blob/main/LICENSE[Apache License, version 2 ("ALv2")].
If you make your plugin publicly available via http://rubygems.org[RubyGems.org],
please make sure to have this line in your gemspec:

* `s.licenses = ['Apache License (2.0)']`

==== Publish to http://rubygems.org[RubyGems.org]

Youâ€™ll need an account on RubyGems.org

* https://rubygems.org/sign_up[Sign-up for a RubyGems account].

After creating an account,
http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#api-authorization[obtain] an API
key from RubyGems.org. By default, RubyGems uses the file `~/.gem/credentials`
to store your API key. These credentials will be used to publish the gem.
Replace `username` and `password` with the credentials you created at
RubyGems.org:

[source,sh]
----------------------------------
curl -u username:password https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yaml > ~/.gem/credentials
chmod 0600 ~/.gem/credentials
----------------------------------

Before proceeding, make sure you have the right version in your gemspec file
and commit your changes.

* `s.version = '0.1.0'`

To publish version 0.1.0 of your new logstash gem:

[source,sh]
----------------------------------
bundle install
bundle exec rake vendor
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rake publish_gem
----------------------------------

[NOTE]
========
Execute `rake publish_gem`:

. Reads the version from the gemspec file (`s.version = '0.1.0'`)
. Checks in your local repository if a tag exists for that version. If the tag
already exists, it aborts the process. Otherwise, it creates a new version tag
in your local repository.
. Builds the gem
. Publishes the gem to RubyGems.org
========

That's it! Your plugin is published! Logstash users can now install your plugin
by running:

[source,sh]
[subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------
bin/plugin install logstash-{plugintype}-mypluginname
----------------------------------

Where <plugintype> is `input`, `output`, `filter`, or `codec`, and
<mypluginname> is the name of your new plugin.
