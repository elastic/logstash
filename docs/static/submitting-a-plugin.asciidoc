=== Submitting your plugin to RubyGems.org and the logstash-plugins repository

Logstash uses http://rubygems.org[RubyGems.org] as its repository for all plugin
artifacts. Once you have developed your new plugin, you can make it available to
Logstash users by simply publishing it to RubyGems.org.

==== Licensing
Logstash and all its plugins are licensed under
https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/blob/master/LICENSE[Apache License, version 2 ("ALv2")].
If you make your plugin publicly available via http://rubygems.org[RubyGems.org],
please make sure to have this line in your gemspec:

* `s.licenses = ['Apache License (2.0)']`

==== Publishing to http://rubygems.org[RubyGems.org]

To begin, youâ€™ll need an account on RubyGems.org

* https://rubygems.org/sign_up[Sign-up for a RubyGems account].

After creating an account,
http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#api-authorization[obtain] an API
key from RubyGems.org. By default, RubyGems uses the file `~/.gem/credentials`
to store your API key. These credentials will be used to publish the gem.
Replace `username` and `password` with the credentials you created at
RubyGems.org:

[source,sh]
----------------------------------
curl -u username:password https://rubygems.org/api/v1/api_key.yaml > ~/.gem/credentials
chmod 0600 ~/.gem/credentials
----------------------------------

Before proceeding, make sure you have the right version in your gemspec file
and commit your changes.

* `s.version = '0.1.0'`

To publish version 0.1.0 of your new logstash gem:

[source,sh]
----------------------------------
bundle install
bundle exec rake vendor
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rake publish_gem
----------------------------------

[NOTE]
========
Executing `rake publish_gem`:

. Reads the version from the gemspec file (`s.version = '0.1.0'`)
. Checks in your local repository if a tag exists for that version. If the tag
already exists, it aborts the process. Otherwise, it creates a new version tag
in your local repository.
. Builds the gem
. Publishes the gem to RubyGems.org
========

That's it! Your plugin is published! Logstash users can now install your plugin
by running:

[source,sh]
[subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------
bin/plugin install logstash-{plugintype}-mypluginname
----------------------------------

==== Contributing your source code to https://github.com/logstash-plugins[logstash-plugins]

It is not required to contribute your source code to
https://github.com/logstash-plugins[logstash-plugins] github organization, but
we always welcome new plugins!

==== Benefits

Some of the many benefits of having your plugin in the logstash-plugins
repository are:

* **Discovery** Your plugin will appear in the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html[Logstash Reference],
where Logstash users look first for plugins and documentation.
* **Documentation** Your plugin documentation will automatically be added to the
 http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html[Logstash Reference].
* **Testing** With our testing infrastructure, your plugin will be continuously
tested against current and future releases of Logstash.  As a result, users will
have the assurance that if incompatibilities arise, they will be quickly
discovered and corrected.

==== Acceptance Guidelines

* **Code Review** Your plugin must be reviewed by members of the community for
coherence, quality, readability, stability and security.
* **Tests** Your plugin must contain tests to be accepted.  These tests are also
subject to code review for scope and completeness.  It's ok if you don't know
how to write tests -- we will guide you. We are working on publishing a guide to
creating tests for Logstash which will make it easier.  In the meantime, you can
refer to http://betterspecs.org/ for examples.

To begin migrating your plugin to logstash-plugins, simply create a new
https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/issues[issue] in
the Logstash repository. When the acceptance guidelines are completed, we will
facilitate the move to the logstash-plugins organization using the recommended
https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository/#transferring-from-a-user-to-an-organization[github process].
