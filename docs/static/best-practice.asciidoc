[[tip-cli]] 
=== Command line

[float] 
[[tip-windows-cli]] 
==== Shell commands on Windows OS

Command line examples often show single quotes. 
On Windows systems, replace a single quote `'` with a double quote `"`. 

*Example*

Instead of:

-----
bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin { } } output { stdout {} }'
-----

Use this format on Windows systems:

-----
bin\logstash -e "input { stdin { } } output { stdout {} }"
-----

[[tip-pipelines]]
=== Pipelines

[float]
[[tip-pipeline-mgmt]]
==== Pipeline management

You can manage pipelines in a {ls} instance using either local pipeline configurations or
{logstash-ref}/configuring-centralized-pipelines.html[centralized pipeline management]
in {kib}.

After you configure Logstash to use centralized pipeline management, you can
no longer specify local pipeline configurations. The `pipelines.yml` file and
settings such as `path.config` and `config.string` are inactive when centralized
pipeline management is enabled.

[[tip-kafka]]
=== Kafka

[float]
[[tip-kafka-settings]]
==== Kafka settings

[float]
[[tip-kafka-partitions]]
===== Partitions per topic

"How many partitions should I use per topic?"

At least the number of {ls} nodes multiplied by consumer threads per node.

Better yet, use a multiple of the above number. Increasing the number of
partitions for an existing topic is extremely complicated. Partitions have a
very low overhead. Using 5 to 10 times the number of partitions suggested by the
first point is generally fine, so long as the overall partition count does not
exceed 2000.

Err on the side of over-partitioning up to a total 1000
partitions overall. Try not to exceed 1000 partitions.

[float]
[[tip-kafka-threads]]
===== Consumer threads

"How many consumer threads should I configure?"

Lower values tend to be more efficient and have less memory overhead. Try a
value of `1` then iterate your way up. The value should in general be lower than
the number of pipeline workers. Values larger than 4 rarely result in
performance improvement.

[float]
[[tip-kafka-pq-persist]]
==== Kafka input and persistent queue (PQ)

[float]
[[tip-kafka-offset-commit]]
===== Kafka offset commits

"Does Kafka Input commit offsets only after the event has been safely persisted to the PQ?"

"Does Kafa Input commit offsets only for events that have passed the pipeline fully?"

No, we can’t make that guarantee. Offsets are committed to Kafka periodically. If
writes to the PQ are slow or blocked, offsets for events that haven’t safely
reached the PQ can be committed.
