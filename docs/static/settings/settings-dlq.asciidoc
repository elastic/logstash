These settings apply when `dead_letter_queue.enable: true`. 

`dead_letter_queue.enable`:: Flag to turn on dead letter queue (DLQ) supported by plugins. Default is `false`. 

`dead_letter_queue.max_bytes`:: Applies when `dead_letter_queue.enable: true`. The maximum size of each dead letter queue (DLQ). 
Entries will be dropped if they would increase the size of the dead letter queue beyond this value. Default is `1024mb`.

`dead_letter_queue.flush_interval`:: Applies when `dead_letter_queue.enable: true`. 
The interval in milliseconds a dead letter queue file will be written if no additional DLQ events have been created. 
A low value means that more, smaller queue files may be written. 
A larger value introduces more latency between items being "written" to the dead letter queue and available to be read by the dead_letter_queue input.
Default is 5000. 

`dead_letter_queue.storage_policy`:: Applies when `dead_letter_queue.enable: true`. 
Defines the action to take when the dead_letter_queue.max_bytes is reached.
Options are "drop_newer" (default) or "drop_older". 
With drop_newer, messages that were inserted most recently are dropped, logging an error line. With drop_older setting, the oldest messages are dropped as new ones are inserted. 
Default value is "drop_newer". 

`path.dead_letter_queue`:: If `dead_letter_queue.enable: true`, sets the directory path where the data files will be stored. 
Default is `path.data/dead_letter_queue`.
