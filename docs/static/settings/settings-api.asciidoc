api.enabled::
The HTTP API is enabled by default. It can be disabled, but features that rely on it will not work as intended. Default is `true`.

api.environment:: 
The API returns the provided string as a part of its response. Setting your environment may help to disambiguate between similarly-named nodes in production vs test environments. 
Default is `production`.

api.http.host::
The bind address for the HTTP API endpoint. 
By default, the {ls} HTTP API binds only to the local loopback interface.
When configured securely (`api.ssl.enabled: true` and `api.auth.type: basic`), the HTTP API binds to _all_ available interfaces. 
Default is `"127.0.0.1"`.

api.http.port::
The bind port for the HTTP API endpoint. 
Default is `9600-9700`.

api.ssl.enabled::
Set to `true` to enable SSL on the HTTP API. 
Doing so requires both `api.ssl.keystore.path` and `api.ssl.keystore.password` to be set. +
Default is `false.`

api.ssl.keystore.path::
The path to a valid JKS or PKCS12 keystore for use in securing the {ls} API. 
The keystore must be password-protected, and must contain a single certificate chain and a private key.  This setting is ignored unless `api.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`.

api.ssl.keystore.password::
The password to the keystore provided with `api.ssl.keystore.path`. 
This setting is ignored unless `api.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`.

api.auth.type::
Set to `basic` to require HTTP Basic auth on the API using the credentials supplied with `api.auth.basic.username` and `api.auth.basic.password`. 
Default is `none`.

api.auth.basic.username::
The username to require for HTTP Basic auth. 
Ignored unless `api.auth.type` is set to `basic`.

api.auth.basic.password::
The password to require for HTTP Basic auth. Ignored unless `api.auth.type` is set to `basic`. 
It should meet default password policy which requires non-empty minimum 8 char string that includes a digit, upper case letter and lower case letter. 
You can customize the default password policy with these options:

* Set `api.auth.basic.password_policy.include.digit` `REQUIRED` (default) to accept only passwords that include at least one digit or `OPTIONAL` to exclude from requirement.
* Set `api.auth.basic.password_policy.include.upper` `REQUIRED` (default) to accept only passwords that include at least one upper case letter or `OPTIONAL` to exclude from requirement.
* Set `api.auth.basic.password_policy.include.lower` `REQUIRED` (default) to accept only passwords that include at least one lower case letter or `OPTIONAL` to exclude from requirement.
* Set `api.auth.basic.password_policy.include.symbol` `REQUIRED` to accept only passwords that include at least one special character or `OPTIONAL` (default) to exclude from requirement.
* Set `api.auth.basic.password_policy.length.minimum` to a value from 9 to 1024 if you want to require more than the 8 character default setting for passwords.

api.auth.basic.password_policy.mode:: 
Raises either `WARN` or `ERROR` message when password requirements are not met. 
Ignored unless `api.auth.type` is set to `basic`. Default is  `WARN`.
