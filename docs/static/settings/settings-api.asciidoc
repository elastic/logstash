:apienabled: api.enabled
:apienabled-desc: The HTTP API is enabled by default. It can be disabled, but features that rely on it will not work as intended. Default is `true`.

:apienvironment: api.environment
:apienvironment-desc: The API returns the provided string as a part of its response. Setting your environment may help to disambiguate between similarly-named nodes in production vs test environments. +
Default is `production`.

:apihttp_host: api.http.host
:apihttp_host-desc: The bind address for the HTTP API endpoint. +
By default, the {ls} HTTP API binds only to the local loopback interface.
When configured securely (`api.ssl.enabled: true` and `api.auth.type: basic`), the HTTP API binds to _all_ available interfaces. +
Default is `"127.0.0.1"`.

:apihttp_port: api.http.port
:apihttp_port-desc: The bind port for the HTTP API endpoint. +
Default is `9600-9700`.

:apissl_enabled: api.ssl.enabled
:apissl_enabled-desc: Set to `true` to enable SSL on the HTTP API. +
Doing so requires both `api.ssl.keystore.path` and `api.ssl.keystore.password` to be set. +
Default is `false.`

:apissl_keystore_path: api.ssl.keystore.path
:apissl_keystore_path-desc: The path to a valid JKS or PKCS12 keystore for use in securing the {ls} API. +
The keystore must be password-protected, and must contain a single certificate chain and a private key.  This setting is ignored unless `api.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`.

:apissl_keystore_password: api.ssl.keystore.password
:apissl_keystore_password-desc: The password to the keystore provided with `api.ssl.keystore.path`. +
This setting is ignored unless `api.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`.

:apiauthtype: api.auth.type
:apiauthtype-desc: Set to `basic` to require HTTP Basic auth on the API using the credentials supplied with `api.auth.basic.username` and `api.auth.basic.password`. +
Default is `none`.

:apiauth_basic_username: api.auth.basic.username
:apiauth_basic_username-desc: The username to require for HTTP Basic auth. +
Ignored unless `api.auth.type` is set to `basic`.

:apiauth_basic_pw: api.auth.basic.password
:apiauth_basic_pw-desc: The password to require for HTTP Basic auth. Ignored unless `api.auth.type` is set to `basic`. +
It should meet default password policy which requires non-empty minimum 8 char string that includes a digit, upper case letter and lower case letter. +
You can customize the default password policy with these options:

//Additional password_policy options are sourced from api-setting.asciidoc to allow for more formatting flexibility
:apiauth.basic.pw_policy.digit: api.auth.basic.password_policy.include.digit
:apiauth.basic.pw_policy.upper: api.auth.basic.password_policy.include.upper
:apiauth.basic.pw_policy.lower: api.auth.basic.password_policy.include.lower
:apiauth.basic.pw_policy.symbol: api.auth.basic.password_policy.include.symbol
:apiauth.basic.pw_policy.minimum: api.auth.basic.password_policy.length.minimum

:apiauth_basic_pw_policy_mode: api.auth.basic.password_policy.mode
:apiauth_basic_pw_policy_mode-desc: Raises either `WARN` or `ERROR` message when password requirements are not met. +
Ignored unless `api.auth.type` is set to `basic`. Default is  `WARN`.
