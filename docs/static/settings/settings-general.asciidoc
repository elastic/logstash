`allow_superuser`::
Allow or block running Logstash as superuser. Default: `true`.

`node.name`::
A descriptive name for the node. Default is machine's hostname.

`path.data`::
The directory that Logstash and its plugins use for any persistent needs, such as persistent queue (PQ) data or dead letter queue (DLQ) data. Default is `LOGSTASH_HOME/data`.

`path.plugins`::
File location for custom plugins. 
You can specify this setting multiple times to include multiple paths. 
Plugins are expected to be in a specific directory hierarchy: `PATH/logstash/TYPE/NAME.rb` where `TYPE` is `inputs`, `filters`, `outputs`, or `codecs`, and `NAME` is the name of the plugin. 
This setting is platform-specific. See <<dir-layout>> for more info.

`modules`::
When configured, modules must be in the nested YAML structure.
