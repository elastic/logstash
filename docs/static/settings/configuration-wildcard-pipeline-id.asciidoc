==== Wildcard support in pipeline ID
++++
<titleabbrev>Wildcard support in pipeline ID</titleabbrev>
++++
Pipeline IDs must begin with a letter or underscore and contain only letters, underscores, dashes, and numbers.
You can use `*` in `xpack.management.pipeline.id` to match any number of letters, underscores, dashes, and numbers.

[source,shell]
-----
xpack.management.pipeline.id: ["*logs", "*apache*", "tomcat_log"]
-----

In this example, `"*logs"` matches all IDs ending in `logs`. `"*apache*"` matches any IDs with `apache` in the name.

Wildcard in pipeline IDs is available starting with Elasticsearch 7.10. Logstash can pick up new pipeline without a restart if the new pipeline ID matches the wildcard pattern.
