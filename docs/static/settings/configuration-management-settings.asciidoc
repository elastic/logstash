==== Configuration Management Settings in Logstash

You can set the following `xpack.management` settings in `logstash.yml` to
enable
<<logstash-centralized-pipeline-management,centralized pipeline management>>.
For more information about configuring Logstash, see <<logstash-settings-file>>.

The following example shows basic settings that assume {es} and {kib} are
installed on the localhost with basic AUTH enabled, but no SSL. If you're using
SSL, you need to specify additional SSL settings.

[source,shell]
-----
xpack.management.enabled: true
xpack.management.elasticsearch.hosts: "http://localhost:9200/"
xpack.management.elasticsearch.username: logstash_admin_user
xpack.management.elasticsearch.password: t0p.s3cr3t
xpack.management.logstash.poll_interval: 5s
xpack.management.pipeline.id: ["apache", "cloudwatch_logs"]
-----


`xpack.management.enabled`::

Set to `true` to enable {xpack} centralized configuration management for
Logstash.

`xpack.management.logstash.poll_interval`::

How often the Logstash instance polls for pipeline changes from Elasticsearch.
The default is 5s.

`xpack.management.pipeline.id`::

Specify a comma-separated list of pipeline IDs to register for centralized
pipeline management. After changing this setting, you need to restart Logstash
to pick up changes.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.hosts`::

The {es} instance that will store the Logstash pipeline configurations and
metadata. This might be the same {es} instance specified in the `outputs`
section in your Logstash configuration, or a different one. Defaults to
`http://localhost:9200`.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.username` and `xpack.management.elasticsearch.password`::

If your {es} cluster is protected with basic authentication, these settings
provide the username and password that the Logstash instance uses to
authenticate for accessing the configuration data. The username you specify here
should have the built-in `logstash_admin` role and the customized `logstash_writer` role, which provides access to `.logstash-*`
indices for managing configurations. 

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.proxy`::

Optional setting that allows you to specify a proxy URL if Logstash needs to use a proxy
to reach your Elasticsearch cluster.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate_authority`::

Optional setting that enables you to specify a path to the `.pem` file for the
certificate authority for your {es} instance.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`::

Optional setting that provides the path to the Java keystore (JKS) to validate
the server’s certificate.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.password`::

Optional setting that provides the password to the truststore.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path`::

Optional setting that provides the path to the Java keystore (JKS) to validate
the client’s certificate.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.password`::

Optional setting that provides the password to the keystore.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.cloud_id`::

If you're using {es} in {ecloud}, you should specify the identifier here.
This setting is an alternative to `xpack.management.elasticsearch.hosts`.
If `cloud_id` is configured, `xpack.management.elasticsearch.hosts` should not be used.
This {es} instance will store the Logstash pipeline configurations and metadata.

`xpack.management.elasticsearch.cloud_auth`::

If you're using {es} in {ecloud}, you can set your auth credentials here.
This setting is an alternative to both `xpack.management.elasticsearch.username`
and `xpack.management.elasticsearch.password`. If `cloud_auth` is configured,
those settings should not be used.
The credentials you specify here should be for a user with the `logstash_admin` role, which
provides access to `.logstash-*` indices for managing configurations.
