[[dead-letter-queues]]
=== Dead letter queues (DLQ)

The dead letter queue (DLQ) is designed as a place to temporarily write events that cannot be processed. 
The DLQ gives you flexibility to investigate problematic events without blocking the pipeline or losing the events. 
Your pipeline keeps flowing, and the immediate problem is averted.
But those events still need to be addressed.  

You can <<es-proc-dlq,process events from the DLQ>> with the <<plugins-inputs-dead_letter_queue,`dead_letter_queue` input plugin>> .

Processing events does not delete items from the queue, and the DLQ sometimes needs attention.
See <<dlq-size>> and <<dlq-clear>> for more info. 

[[dead-letter-how]]
==== How the dead letter queue works

By default, when Logstash encounters an event that it cannot process because the
data contains a mapping error or some other issue, the Logstash pipeline 
either hangs or drops the unsuccessful event. In order to protect against data
loss in this situation, you can <<configuring-dlq,configure Logstash>> to write
unsuccessful events to a dead letter queue instead of dropping them.

NOTE: The dead letter queue is currently supported only for the
<<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,{es} output>>. The dead letter queue is used for
documents with response codes of 400 or 404, both of which indicate an event
that cannot be retried.

Each event written to the dead letter queue includes the original event,
metadata that describes the reason the event could not be processed, information
about the plugin that wrote the event, and the timestamp when the event
entered the dead letter queue.

To process events in the dead letter queue, create a Logstash pipeline
configuration that uses the
<<plugins-inputs-dead_letter_queue,`dead_letter_queue` input plugin>> to read
from the queue. See <<processing-dlq-events>> for more information.

[[es-proc-dlq]]
==== {es} processing and the dead letter queue

**HTTP request failure.** If the HTTP request fails (because {es} is unreachable
or because it returned an HTTP error code), the {es} output retries the entire
request indefinitely. In these scenarios, the dead letter queue has no
opportunity to intercept.

**HTTP request success.** The {ref}/docs-bulk.html[{es} Bulk API] can perform
multiple actions using the same request. If the Bulk API request is successful,
it returns `200 OK`, even if some documents in the batch have
{ref}/docs-bulk.html#bulk-failures-ex[failed]. In this situation, the `errors`
flag for the request will be `true`.

The response body can include metadata indicating that one or more specific
actions in the bulk request could not be performed, along with an HTTP-style
status code per entry to indicate why the action could not be performed.
If the DLQ is configured, individual indexing failures are routed there.

Even if you regularly process events, events remain in the dead letter queue.
The dead letter queue requires <<dlq-clear,manual intervention>> to clear it. 

[[configuring-dlq]]
==== Configuring {ls} to use dead letter queues

Dead letter queues are disabled by default. To enable dead letter queues, set
the `dead_letter_queue_enable` option in the `logstash.yml`
<<logstash-settings-file,settings file>>: 

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dead_letter_queue.enable: true
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dead letter queues are stored as files in the local directory of the Logstash
instance. By default, the dead letter queue files are stored in
`path.data/dead_letter_queue`. Each pipeline has a separate queue. For example,
the dead letter queue for the `main` pipeline is stored in
`LOGSTASH_HOME/data/dead_letter_queue/main` by default. The queue files are
numbered sequentially: `1.log`, `2.log`, and so on.

You can set `path.dead_letter_queue` in the `logstash.yml` file to
specify a different path for the files:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
path.dead_letter_queue: "path/to/data/dead_letter_queue"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TIP: Use the local filesystem for data integrity and performance. Network File System (NFS) is not supported.

Dead letter queue entries are written to a temporary file, which is then renamed
 to a dead letter queue segment file, which is then eligible for ingestion. The rename
 happens either when this temporary file is considered 'full', or when a period
 of time has elapsed since the last dead letter queue eligible event was written
 to the temporary file.

This length of time can be set using the `dead_letter_queue.flush_interval` setting.
 This setting is in milliseconds, and defaults to 5000ms. A low value here will mean
 in the event of infrequent writes to the dead letter queue more, smaller, queue
 files may be written, while a larger value will introduce more latency between
 items being "written" to the dead letter queue, and being made available for
 reading by the dead_letter_queue input.

 Note that this value cannot be set to lower than 1000ms.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dead_letter_queue.flush_interval: 5000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: You may not use the same `dead_letter_queue` path for two different
Logstash instances.

[[file-rotation]]
===== File rotation

Dead letter queues have a built-in file rotation policy that manages the file
size of the queue. When the file size reaches a preconfigured threshold, a new
file is created automatically.

[[size-management]]
===== Size management
By default, the maximum size of each dead letter queue is set to 1024mb. To
change this setting, use the `dead_letter_queue.max_bytes` option.  Entries
will be dropped if they would increase the size of the dead letter queue beyond
this setting.
Use the `dead_letter_queue.storage_policy` option to control which entries should be dropped to avoid exceeding the size limit. 
Set the value to `drop_newer` (default) to stop accepting new values that would push the file size over the limit. 
Set the value to `drop_older` to remove the oldest events to make space for new ones.

[[age-policy]]
====== Age policy
You can use the age policy to automatically control the volume of events in the dead letter queue.
Use the the `dead_letter_queue.retain.age` setting (in `logstash.yml` or `pipelines.yml`) to have {ls}
remove events that are older than a value you define.
Available time units are `d`, `h`, `m`, `s` respectively for days, hours, minutes and seconds.
There is no default time unit, so you need to specify it.

[source,yaml]
-----
dead_letter_queue.retain.age: 2d
-----

The age policy is verified and applied on event writes and during pipeline shutdown.
For that reason, your dead-letter-queue folder may store expired events for longer than specified,
and the reader pipeline could possibly encounter outdated events.

[[auto-clean]]
===== Automatic cleaning of consumed events

By default, the dead letter queue input plugin does not remove the events that it consumes.
Instead, it commits a reference to avoid re-processing events.
Use the `clean_consumed` setting in the dead letter queue input plugin in order
to remove segments that have been fully consumed, freeing space while processing.

[source,yaml]
-----
input {
  dead_letter_queue {
  	path => "/path/to/data/dead_letter_queue"
  	pipeline_id => "main"
    clean_consumed => true 
  }
}
-----

[[processing-dlq-events]]
==== Processing events in the dead letter queue

When you are ready to process events in the dead letter queue, you create a
pipeline that uses the
<<plugins-inputs-dead_letter_queue,`dead_letter_queue` input plugin>> to read
from the dead letter queue. The pipeline configuration that you use depends, of
course, on what you need to do. For example, if the dead letter queue contains
events that resulted from a mapping error in Elasticsearch, you can create a
pipeline that reads the "dead" events, removes the field that caused the mapping
issue, and re-indexes the clean events into Elasticsearch. 

The following example shows a simple pipeline that reads events from the dead
letter queue and writes the events, including metadata, to standard output: 

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input {
  dead_letter_queue {
    path => "/path/to/data/dead_letter_queue" <1>
    commit_offsets => true <2>
    pipeline_id => "main" <3>
  }
}

output {
  stdout {
    codec => rubydebug { metadata => true }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The path to the top-level directory containing the dead letter queue. This
directory contains a separate folder for each pipeline that writes to the dead
letter queue. To find the path to this directory, look at the `logstash.yml`
<<logstash-settings-file,settings file>>. By default, Logstash creates the
`dead_letter_queue` directory under the location used for persistent
storage (`path.data`), for example, `LOGSTASH_HOME/data/dead_letter_queue`.
However, if `path.dead_letter_queue` is set, it uses that location instead.
<2> When `true`, saves the offset. When the pipeline restarts, it will continue
reading from the position where it left off rather than reprocessing all the
items in the queue. You can set `commit_offsets` to `false` when you are
exploring events in the dead letter queue and want to iterate over the events
multiple times. 
<3> The ID of the pipeline that's writing to the dead letter queue. The default
is `"main"`.

For another example, see <<dlq-example>>.

When the pipeline has finished processing all the events in the dead letter
queue, it will continue to run and process new events as they stream into the
queue. This means that you do not need to stop your production system to handle
events in the dead letter queue. 

NOTE: Events emitted from the
<<plugins-inputs-dead_letter_queue,`dead_letter_queue` input plugin>> plugin
will not be resubmitted to the dead letter queue if they cannot be processed
correctly.

[[dlq-timestamp]]
==== Reading from a timestamp

When you read from the dead letter queue, you might not want to process all the
events in the queue, especially if there are a lot of old events in the queue.
You can start processing events at a specific point in the queue by using the
`start_timestamp` option. This option configures the pipeline to start
processing events based on the timestamp of when they entered the queue:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input {
  dead_letter_queue {
    path => "/path/to/data/dead_letter_queue" 
    start_timestamp => "2017-06-06T23:40:37"
    pipeline_id => "main"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this example, the pipeline starts reading all events that were delivered to
the dead letter queue on or after June 6, 2017, at 23:40:37. 

[[dlq-example]]
==== Example: Processing data that has mapping errors

In this example, the user attempts to index a document that includes geo_ip data,
but the data cannot be processed because it contains a mapping error:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{"geoip":{"location":"home"}}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indexing fails because the Logstash output plugin expects a `geo_point` object in
the `location` field, but the value is a string. The failed event is written to
the dead letter queue, along with metadata about the error that caused the
failure:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
   "@metadata" => {
    "dead_letter_queue" => {
       "entry_time" => #<Java::OrgLogstash::Timestamp:0x5b5dacd5>,
        "plugin_id" => "fb80f1925088497215b8d037e622dec5819b503e-4",
      "plugin_type" => "elasticsearch",
           "reason" => "Could not index event to Elasticsearch. status: 400, action: [\"index\", {:_id=>nil, :_index=>\"logstash-2017.06.22\", :_type=>\"doc\", :_routing=>nil}, 2017-06-22T01:29:29.804Z My-MacBook-Pro-2.local {\"geoip\":{\"location\":\"home\"}}], response: {\"index\"=>{\"_index\"=>\"logstash-2017.06.22\", \"_type\"=>\"doc\", \"_id\"=>\"AVzNayPze1iR9yDdI2MD\", \"status\"=>400, \"error\"=>{\"type\"=>\"mapper_parsing_exception\", \"reason\"=>\"failed to parse\", \"caused_by\"=>{\"type\"=>\"illegal_argument_exception\", \"reason\"=>\"illegal latitude value [266.30859375] for geoip.location\"}}}}"
    }
  },
  "@timestamp" => 2017-06-22T01:29:29.804Z,
    "@version" => "1",
       "geoip" => {
    "location" => "home"
  },
        "host" => "My-MacBook-Pro-2.local",
     "message" => "{\"geoip\":{\"location\":\"home\"}}"
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To process the failed event, you create the following pipeline that reads from
the dead letter queue and removes the mapping problem:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input { 
  dead_letter_queue { 
    path => "/path/to/data/dead_letter_queue/" <1>
  } 
} 
filter {
  mutate { 
    remove_field => "[geoip][location]" <2>
  } 
} 
output { 
  elasticsearch{
    hosts => [ "localhost:9200" ] <3>
  } 
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> The <<plugins-inputs-dead_letter_queue,`dead_letter_queue` input>> reads from the dead letter queue.
<2> The `mutate` filter removes the problem field called `location`.
<3> The clean event is sent to Elasticsearch, where it can be indexed because
the mapping issue is resolved.

[[dlq-size]]
==== Track dead letter queue size

Monitor the size of the dead letter queue before it becomes a problem.
By checking it periodically, you can determine the maximum queue size that makes sense for each pipeline. 

The size of the DLQ for each pipeline is available in the node stats API.

[source,txt]
-----
pipelines.${pipeline_id}.dead_letter_queue.queue_size_in_bytes.
-----

Where `{pipeline_id}` is the name of a pipeline with DLQ enabled. 


[[dlq-clear]]
==== Clear the dead letter queue

The dead letter queue cannot be cleared with the upstream pipeline running. 

The dead letter queue is a directory of pages. 
To clear it, stop the pipeline and delete location/<file-name>.

[source,txt]
-----
${path.data}/dead_letter_queue/${pipeline_id}
-----

Where `{pipeline_id}` is the name of a pipeline with DLQ enabled. 

The pipeline creates a new dead letter queue when it starts again.
