<titleabbrev>Legacy internal collection (deprecated)</titleabbrev>
++++

deprecated[7.7.0]

Starting in {ls} version 7.7, the legacy settings for internal collection are deprecated and
will be removed in version 8.0.0. Instead of sending monitoring data to {es} exporter,
itâ€™s recommended that you use the <<monitoring-internal-collection,internal collection>>
to route monitoring data directly to your monitoring indices.

Or as an alternative to internal collection, use <<monitoring-with-metricbeat, {metricbeat} collection>>.
