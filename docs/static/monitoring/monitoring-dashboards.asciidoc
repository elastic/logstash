=== Monitoring UI

Use the {stack} {monitor-features} to view metrics and gain insight into how
your {ls} deployment is running. In the overview dashboard, you can see all
events received and sent by Logstash, plus info about memory usage and uptime:

Then you can drill down to see stats about a specific node:

NOTE: A {ls} node is considered unique based on its persistent UUID, which
is written to the <<logstash-settings-file,`path.data`>> directory when the node
starts.

Before you can use the monitoring UI,
<<configuring-logstash, configure Logstash monitoring>>.

For information about using the Monitoring UI, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[{monitoring} in {kib}].
