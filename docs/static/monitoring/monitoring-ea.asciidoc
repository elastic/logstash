=== Collect {ls} monitoring data with {agent}
[subs="attributes"]
++++
<titleabbrev>{agent} collection for Stack Monitoring</titleabbrev>
++++

You can use {agent} to collect data about {ls} and ship it to the monitoring
cluster. The benefit of {agent} collection is that the monitoring agent remains
active even if the {ls} instance does not. Plus you can manage all your
monitoring agents from a central location in {fleet}.

To collect and ship monitoring data:

. <<disable-default-include-ea,Disable default collection of monitoring metrics>>
. <<define-cluster__uuid-include-ea,Specify the target `cluster_uuid` (optional)>>
. <<configure-metricbeat,Install and configure {agent} to collect monitoring data>>

=== Step 1: Add the {agent} Logstash integration

{agent} is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other
types of data to a host. Each agent has a single policy you can update to add
integrations for new data sources, security protections, and more.

In this step, add the {ls} integration to monitor host logs and metrics.

. Go to the {kib} home page and click **Add integrations**.

. In the query bar, search for **Logstash** and select the integration to see more
details about it.

. Click **Add Logstash**.

. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.

[[configure-logstash-logs-ea]]
==== Configure {agent} to collect {ls} Logs

Make sure that **Logs** is turned on.

. Make sure you configure all required settings:
* Under **Logs**, modify the log paths
to match your {ls} environment.

[[configure-logstash-stack-monitoring]]
==== Configure {agent} with Stack Monitoring

Make sure that **Metrics (Stack Monitoring)** is turned on, and **Metrics (Technical Preview)** is turned off.

* Under **Metrics (Stack Monitoring)**, make sure the hosts setting
points to your {ls} host URLs. By default, the integration collects {ls}
monitoring metrics from `localhost:9600`. If that host and port number are not
correct, update the `hosts` setting. If you configured {ls} to use encrypted
communications, you must access it via HTTPS. For example, use a `hosts` setting
like
`https://localhost:9600`.
