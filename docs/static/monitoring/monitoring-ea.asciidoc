ToDo: Add brief intro describing the feature and value prop. 
So far, we haven't differentiated between the two. 
Add info to help them decide which one they want to use.  

**Prerequisites**

Complete these steps as you prepare to collect and ship monitoring data for stack monitoring:

[[disable-default-include-ea]]
.Disable default collection of {ls} monitoring metrics

[[define-cluster__uuid-ea]]
.Specify the target cluster_uuid (optional)
[%collapsible]
====

====

[[set-up-monitoring-ea]]
.Set up {es} monitoring

=== Install and configure {agent}

When you have completed the prerequisites, install and configure {agent} to monitor host logs and metrics.
We'll walk you through the process in these steps:

* <<add-logstash-integration-ea>>
* <<add-agent-to-fleet-ea>>
* <<view-assets>>
* <<view-data-stack>>

[[add-logstash-integration-ea]]
==== Add the {agent} {ls} integration

. Go to the {kib} home page, and click **Add integrations**.

--

. In the query bar, search for **Logstash** and select the integration to see more
details about it.

. Click **Add {ls}**.

. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description.

. Configure the integration to collect logs.
* Make sure that **Logs** is turned on if you want to collect logs from your {ls} instance, ensuring that the required settings are correctly configured:
* Under **Logs**, modify the log paths
to match your {ls} environment.

. Configure the integration to collect metrics
* Make sure that **Metrics (Stack Monitoring)** is turned on, and **Metrics (Technical Preview)** is turned off, if you
want to collect metrics from your Logstash instance
* Under **Metrics (Stack Monitoring)**, make sure the hosts setting
points to your {ls} host URLs. By default, the integration collects {ls}
monitoring metrics from `localhost:9600`. If that host and port number are not
correct, update the `hosts` setting. If you configured {ls} to use encrypted
communications, you must access it via HTTPS. For example, use a `hosts` setting
like
`https://localhost:9600`.

. Choose where to add the integration policy. +
Click **New hosts** to add it to new agent policy or **Existing hosts** to add it to an existing agent policy.
. In the popup, click **Add {agent} to your hosts** to open the **Add agent**
flyout.
+
TIP: If you accidentally close the popup, go to **{fleet} > Agents**, then click
**Add agent** to access the flyout.
