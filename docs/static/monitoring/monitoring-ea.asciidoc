=== Collect {ls} monitoring data with {agent}
[subs="attributes"]
++++
<titleabbrev>{agent} collection</titleabbrev>
++++

You can use {agent} to collect data about {ls} and ship it to the monitoring
cluster. The benefit of {agent} collection is that the monitoring agent remains
active even if the {ls} instance does not. Plus you can manage all your
monitoring agents from a central location in {fleet}.

To collect and ship monitoring data:

. <<disable-default-include,Disable default collection of monitoring metrics>>
. <<define-cluster__uuid-include,Specify the target `cluster_uuid` (optional)>>
. <<configure-metricbeat,Install and configure {agent} to collect monitoring data>>

==== Install and configure {agent}

Prerequisites:

* Set up {es} monitoring and optionally create a monitoring cluster as described
in the {ref}/monitoring-production.html[{es} monitoring documentation].
* Create a user on the production cluster that has the
`remote_monitoring_collector` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in role].

To collect {ls} monitoring data, add a {ls} integration to an {agent} and
deploy it to the host where {ls} is running.

. Go to the {kib} home page and click **Add integrations**.
+
NOTE: If you're using a monitoring cluster, use the {kib} instance connected to
the monitoring cluster.

. In the query bar, search for and select the **Logstash** integration for
{agent}.
. Read the overview to make sure you understand integration requirements and
other considerations.
. Click **Add Logstash**.
+
TIP: If you're installing an integration for the first time, you may be prompted
to install {agent}. Click **Add integration only (skip agent installation)**.

. Configure the integration name and optionally add a description. Make sure you
configure all required settings:
* Under **Collect Logstash application and slowlog logs**, modify the log paths
to match your {ls} environment.
* Under **Collect Logstash node metrics and stats**, make sure the hosts setting
points to your {ls} host URLs. By default, the integration collects {ls}
monitoring metrics from `localhost:9600`. If that host and port number are not
correct, update the `hosts` setting. If you configured {ls} to use encrypted
communications, you must access it via HTTPS. For example, use a `hosts` setting
like
`https://localhost:9600`.
+
**Elastic security.** The Elastic {security-features} are enabled by default. 
Expand **Advanced options** and enter the username and password of a user that has
the `remote_monitoring_collector` role.
. Choose where to add the integration policy. Click **New hosts** to add it to
new agent policy or **Existing hosts** to add it to an existing agent policy.
. Click **Save and continue**. This step takes a minute or two to complete. When
it's done, you'll have an agent policy that contains an integration for
collecting monitoring data from {kib}.
. If an {agent} is already assigned to the policy and deployed to the host where
{kib} is running, you're done. Otherwise, you need to deploy an {agent}. To
deploy an {agent}:
.. Go to **{fleet} -> Agents**, then click **Add agent**.
.. Follow the steps in the **Add agent** flyout to download, install,
and enroll the {agent}. Make sure you choose the agent policy you created
earlier.
. Wait a minute or two until incoming data is confirmed.
