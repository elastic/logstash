After you have confirmed enrollment and data is coming in,  click **View assets** to access dashboards related to the {ls} integration.

For traditional Stack Monitoring UI, the dashboards marked **[Logs {ls}]** are used to visualize the logs
produced by your {ls} instances, with those marked **[Metrics {ls}]** for the technical preview metrics
dashboards.
These are populated with data only if you selected the **Metrics (Technical Preview)** checkbox.

A number of dashboards are included to view {ls} as a whole, and dashboards that allow you to drill-down
into how {ls} is performing on a node, pipeline and plugin basis.
