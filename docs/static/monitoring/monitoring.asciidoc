== Monitoring {ls} with APIs

When you run {ls}, it automatically captures runtime metrics that you can
use to monitor the health and performance of your {ls} deployment.

The metrics collected by {ls} include:

* {ls} node info, like pipeline settings, OS info, and JVM info.
* Plugin info, including a list of installed plugins.
* Node stats, like JVM stats, process stats, event-related stats, and pipeline
runtime stats.
* Hot threads.

You can use <<monitoring,monitoring APIs>> provided by {ls}
to retrieve these metrics. These APIs are available by default without
requiring any extra configuration.

Alternatively, you can <<configuring-logstash,configure {monitoring}>> to send
data to a monitoring cluster.

NOTE: Monitoring is a feature under the Basic License and is therefore
*free to use*.
