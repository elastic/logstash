== Monitoring Logstash with APIs

When you run Logstash, it automatically captures runtime metrics that you can
use to monitor the health and performance of your Logstash deployment.

The metrics collected by Logstash include:

* Logstash node info, like pipeline settings, OS info, and JVM info.
* Plugin info, including a list of installed plugins.
* Node stats, like JVM stats, process stats, event-related stats, and pipeline
runtime stats.
* Hot threads.

You can use <<monitoring,monitoring APIs>> provided by Logstash
to retrieve these metrics. These APIs are available by default without
requiring any extra configuration.

Alternatively, you can <<configuring-logstash,configure {monitoring}>> to send
data to a monitoring cluster.

NOTE: Monitoring is a feature under the Basic License and is therefore
*free to use*.
