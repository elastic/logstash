==== Collectors

Collectors, as their name implies, collect things. In {monitoring} for Logstash, 
collectors are just <<pipeline,Inputs>> in the same way that ordinary Logstash 
configurations provide inputs.

Like {monitoring} for {es}, each collector can create zero or more monitoring 
documents. As it is currently implemented, each Logstash node runs two types of 
collectors: one for node stats and one for pipeline stats.

|=======================
| Collector       | Data Types | Description
| Node Stats      | `logstash_stats`
| Gathers details about the running node, such as memory utilization and CPU
usage (for example, `GET /_stats`).

This runs on every Logstash node with {monitoring} enabled. One common
failure is that Logstash directories are copied with their `path.data` directory
included (`./data` by default), which copies the persistent UUID of the Logstash
node along with it. As a result, it generally appears that one or more Logstash
nodes are failing to collect monitoring data, when in fact they are all really
misreporting as the _same_ Logstash node. Re-use `path.data` directories only 
when upgrading Logstash, such that upgraded nodes replace the previous versions.
| Pipeline Stats | `logstash_state`
| Gathers details about the node's running pipelines, which powers the 
Monitoring Pipeline UI.
|=======================

Per collection interval, which defaults to 10 seconds (`10s`), each collector is
run. The failure of an individual collector does not impact any other collector. 
Each collector, as an ordinary Logstash input, creates a separate Logstash event 
in its isolated monitoring pipeline. The Logstash output then sends the data.

The collection interval can be configured dynamically and you can also disable 
data collection. For more information about the configuration options for the 
collectors, see <<monitoring-settings>>.

WARNING: Unlike {monitoring} for {es} and {kib}, there is no 
`xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting on Logstash. You must use the 
`xpack.monitoring.enabled` setting to enable and disable data collection. 

If gaps exist in the monitoring charts in {kib}, it is typically because either 
a collector failed or the monitoring cluster did not receive the data (for 
example, it was being restarted). In the event that a collector fails, a logged 
error should exist on the node that attempted to perform the collection.
