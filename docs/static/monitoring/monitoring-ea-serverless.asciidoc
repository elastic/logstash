{ls} monitoring is available on {serverless-full} through the https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/main/packages/logstash/_dev/build/docs/README.md[{ls} Integration] in {serverless-docs}/observability/what-is-observability-serverless[Elastic Observability].
{agent} collects monitoring data from your {ls} instance, sends it directly to {serverless-full}, and shows the data in {ls} dashboards.

You'll need to have an {serverless-docs}/observability/what-is-observability-serverless[Elastic Observability] project. 
We'll provide steps to help you create one.

=== Add and configure the {ls} integration

**Add the {ls} integration**

. Log in to your https://cloud.elastic.co/[cloud.elastic.co] account and create an Observability serverless project. 
. Select **Get Started** from the main menu.
. Select **Start exploring** (near the bottom of the page).
. On the **Integrations** page, search for **{ls}** and select it to see details. 
. Click **Add {ls}**. 
. Follow the instructions to install {agent} and add the {ls} integration. 

For more info, check out the {serverless-docs}/observability/what-is-observability-serverless[Elastic Observability] docs.

**Configure the integration to collect logs** 
 
* Make sure that **Logs** is ON if you want to collect logs from your {ls} instance. Check the settings to be sure that they are configured correctly.
* Modify the log paths to match your {ls} environment.

**Configure the integration to collect metrics**

* Make sure that  **Metrics (Stack Monitoring)** is OFF, and that **Metrics (Technical Preview)** is ON.
* Set the {ls} URL to point to your {ls} instance. +
By default, the integration collects {ls}
monitoring metrics from `https://localhost:9600`. If that host and port number are not
correct, update the `Logstash URL` setting. If you configured {ls} to use encrypted
communications and/or a username and password, you must access it using HTTPS. Expand the **Advanced Settings** options, and fill in the appropriate values for your {ls} instance.
