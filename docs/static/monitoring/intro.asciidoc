Alternatively, you can <<configuring-logstash,configure {monitoring}>> to send
data to a monitoring cluster.

NOTE: Monitoring is an {xpack} feature under the Basic License and is therefore
*free to use*.

You can use the <<logstash-monitoring-ui,monitoring UI>> in {xpack} to view the
metrics and gain insight into how your Logstash deployment is running.

The <<logstash-pipeline-viewer,pipeline viewer>> in {xpack} offers additional
visibility into the behavior and performance of complex pipeline configurations.
It shows a graph representation of the overall pipeline topology, data flow, and
branching logic, overlaid with important metrics, like events per second, for
each plugin in the view.

This documentation focuses on the {monitoring} infrastructure and setup in
Logstash. For an introduction to monitoring your Elastic stack, including {es}
and {kib}, see {xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack].
