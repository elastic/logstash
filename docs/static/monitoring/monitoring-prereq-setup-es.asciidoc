//=== Set up {es} monitoring (stack monitoring only)

With *Stack Monitoring* it is recommended to set up {ref}/monitoring-overview.html[{es} monitoring] together. Otherwise, {ls} becomes a Standalone Cluster.
If you would like to create a dedicated monitoring cluster (optional), check out {ref}/monitoring-production.html[{es} monitoring documentation].
