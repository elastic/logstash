=== Configuring monitoring for {ls}

Make sure monitoring is enabled on your {es} cluster. Then configure *one* of
these methods to collect {ls} metrics:

* <<monitoring-with-metricbeat, {metricbeat} collection>>. Metricbeat collects
monitoring data from your {ls} instance and sends it directly to your monitoring
cluster. The benefit of Metricbeat collection is that the monitoring
agent remains active even if the {ls} instance does not.

* <<monitoring-internal-collection-legacy,Internal collection>>. 
Internal collectors send monitoring data to your production cluster.
