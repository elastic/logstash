=== Configuring {xpack} monitoring for {ls}

Make sure monitoring is enabled on your {es} cluster. Then configure *one* of
these methods to collect {ls} metrics:

* <<monitoring-with-metricbeat, {metricbeat} collection>>. Metricbeat collects
monitoring data from your {ls} instance and sends it directly to your monitoring
cluster.

* <<monitoring-internal-collection,Internal collection>>. Internal collectors send
monitoring data directly to your monitoring cluster.

* <<monitoring-internal-collection-legacy,Legacy internal collection>>. Legacy
internal collectors send monitoring data to your production cluster.
