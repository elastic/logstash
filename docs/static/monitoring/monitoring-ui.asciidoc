=== Monitoring UI

When running Logstash 5.2 or greater, you can use the
https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/monitoring[monitoring feature in X-Pack]
to gain deep visibility into metrics about your Logstash deployment. In the
overview dashboard, you can see all events received and sent by Logstash, plus
info about memory usage and uptime:

Then you can drill down to see stats about a specific node:

NOTE: A Logstash node is considered unique based on its persistent UUID, which
is written to the <<logstash-settings-file,`path.data`>> directory when the node
starts.

Before you can use the monitoring UI,
<<configuring-logstash, configure Logstash monitoring>>.

For information about using the Monitoring UI, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[{monitoring} in {kib}].
