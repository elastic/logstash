*Common options*

The following configuration options are supported by all modules:

*`var.elasticsearch.hosts`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<uri,uri>>
* Default value is "localhost:9200"
--
+
Sets the host(s) of the Elasticsearch cluster. For each host, you must specify
the hostname and port. For example, "myhost:9200". If given an <<array,array>>,
Logstash will load balance requests across the hosts specified in the hosts
parameter. It is important to exclude {ref}/modules-node.html[dedicated master
nodes] from the hosts list to prevent Logstash from sending bulk requests to the
master nodes. So this parameter should only reference either data or client
nodes in Elasticsearch.
+
Any special characters present in the URLs here MUST be URL escaped! This means #
should be put in as %23 for instance.

*`var.elasticsearch.username`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "elastic"
--
+
The username to authenticate to a secure Elasticsearch cluster.

*`var.elasticsearch.password`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "changeme"
--
+
The password to authenticate to a secure Elasticsearch cluster.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.enabled`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
* There is no default value for this setting.
--
+
Enable SSL/TLS secured communication to the Elasticsearch cluster. Leaving this
unspecified will use whatever scheme is specified in the URLs listed in `hosts`.
If no explicit protocol is specified, plain HTTP will be used. If SSL is
explicitly disabled here, the plugin will refuse to start if an HTTPS URL is
given in hosts.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.verification_mode`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "strict"
--
+
The hostname verification setting when communicating with Elasticsearch. Set to
`disable` to turn off hostname verification. Disabling this has serious security
concerns.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate_authority`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to an X.509 certificate to use to validate SSL certificates when
communicating with Elasticsearch.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.certificate`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to an X.509 certificate to use for client authentication when
communicating with Elasticsearch.

*`var.elasticsearch.ssl.key`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* There is no default value for this setting
--
+
The path to the certificate key for client authentication when communicating
with Elasticsearch.

*`var.kibana.host`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "localhost:5601"
--
+
Sets the hostname and port of the Kibana instance to use for importing
dashboards and visualizations. For example: "myhost:5601".

*`var.kibana.username`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "elastic"

*`var.kibana.ssl.enabled`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
* Default value is false
--
+

*`var.kibana.ssl.verification_mode`*::
+
--
* Value type is <<string,string>>
* Default value is "strict"
--
+
The hostname verification setting when communicating with Kibana. Set to
`disable` to turn off hostname verification. Disabling this has serious security
