== Logstash Loves Data

Collect more, so you can know more. Logstash welcomes data of all shapes and sizes.

[float]
=== Logs and Metrics

Where it all started.

* Handle all types of logging data
** Easily ingest a multitude of web logs like <<advanced-pipeline,Apache>>, and application
logs like <<plugins-inputs-log4j,log4j>> for Java
** Capture many other log formats like <<plugins-inputs-syslog,syslog>>,
<<plugins-inputs-eventlog,Windows event logs>>, networking and firewall logs, and more
* Enjoy complementary secure log forwarding capabilities with https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat[Filebeat]
* Collect metrics from <<plugins-inputs-ganglia,Ganglia>>, <<plugins-codecs-collectd,collectd>>,
<<plugins-codecs-netflow,NetFlow>>, <<plugins-inputs-jmx,JMX>>, and many other infrastructure
and application platforms over <<plugins-inputs-tcp,TCP>> and <<plugins-inputs-udp,UDP>>

[float]
=== The Web

Unlock the World Wide Web.

* Transform <<plugins-inputs-http,HTTP requests>> into events
** Consume from web service firehoses like <<plugins-inputs-twitter,Twitter>> for social sentiment analysis
** Webhook support for GitHub, HipChat, JIRA, and countless other applications
** Enables many https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/alerting[Watcher] alerting use cases
* Create events by polling <<plugins-inputs-http_poller,HTTP endpoints>> on demand
** Universally capture health, performance, metrics, and other types of data from web application interfaces
** Perfect for scenarios where the control of polling is preferred over receiving

[float]
=== Data Stores and Streams

Discover more value from the data you already own.

* Better understand your data from any relational database or NoSQL store with a
<<plugins-inputs-jdbc,JDBC>> interface 
* Unify diverse data streams from messaging queues like Apache <<plugins-outputs-kafka,Kafka>>,
<<plugins-outputs-rabbitmq,RabbitMQ>>, <<plugins-outputs-sqs,Amazon SQS>>, and <<plugins-outputs-zeromq,ZeroMQ>>

[float]
=== Sensors and IoT

Explore an expansive breadth of other data.

* In this age of technological advancement, the massive IoT world unleashes endless use cases through capturing and
harnessing data from connected sensors.
* Logstash is the common event collection backbone for ingestion of data shipped from mobile devices to intelligent
homes, connected vehicles, healthcare sensors, and many other industry specific applications.

[float]
== Easily Enrich Everything

The better the data, the better the knowledge. Clean and transform your data during ingestion to gain near real-time
insights immediately at index or output time. Logstash comes out-of-box with many aggregations and mutations along
with pattern matching, geo mapping, and dynamic lookup capabilities.

* <<plugins-filters-grok,Grok>> is the bread and butter of Logstash filters and is used ubiquitously to derive
structure out of unstructured data. Enjoy a wealth of integrated patterns aimed to help quickly resolve web, systems,
networking, and other types of event formats.
* Expand your horizons by deciphering <<plugins-filters-geoip,geo coordinates>> from IP addresses, normalizing
<<plugins-filters-date,date>> complexity, simplifying <<plugins-filters-kv,key-value pairs>> and
<<plugins-filters-csv,CSV>> data, <<plugins-filters-anonymize,anonymizing>> sensitive information, and further
enriching your data with <<plugins-filters-translate,local lookups>> or Elasticsearch
<<plugins-filters-elasticsearch,queries>>.
* Codecs are often used to ease the processing of common event structures like <<plugins-codecs-json,JSON>>
and <<plugins-codecs-multiline,multiline>> events.
