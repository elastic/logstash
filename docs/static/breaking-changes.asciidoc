== Breaking changes

We strive to maintain backward compatibility between minor versions (8.x to 8.y,
for example) so that you can upgrade without changing any configuration files.
Breaking changes are usually introduced only between major versions (such as 7.x
to 8.y). On occasion, we are forced to break compatibility within a given major release
to ensure correctness of operation.

This section covers the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating to
Logstash 8.0.0 and later.

NOTE: Migrating directly between non-consecutive major versions (6.x to
8.x) is not recommended. 
We suggest that you upgrade to {prev-major-last} before you upgrade to 8.0, 

See these topics for breaking changes in earlier releases:
