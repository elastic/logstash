== Breaking changes

We strive to maintain backward compatibility between minor versions (8.x to 8.y,
for example) so that you can upgrade without changing any configuration files.
Breaking changes are usually introduced only between major versions (such as 7.x
to 8.y). On occasion, we are forced to break compatibility within a given major release
to ensure correctness of operation.

This section covers the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating to
Logstash 8.0.0 and later.

NOTE: Migrating directly between non-consecutive major versions (6.x to
8.x) is not recommended. 
We suggest that you upgrade to {prev-major-last} before you upgrade to 8.0.

[[breaking-8.15]]
=== 8.15

*New {ls} SNMP integration plugin*

Prior to 8.15.0, {ls} bundled stand-alone versions of the `input-snmp` and `input-snmptrap` plugins by default. 
When you upgrade to 8.15.0, the stand-alone plugins are replaced by the 4.0.0+ version contained in the new SNMP integration plugin.

IMPORTANT: Before you upgrade to {ls} 8.15.0, be aware of {logstash-ref}/plugins-integrations-snmp.html#plugins-integrations-snmp-migration[behavioral and mapping differences] between stand-alone plugins and the new versions included in the {logstash-ref}/plugins-integrations-snmp.html[SNMP integration plugin].
If you need to maintain current mappings for the `input-snmptrap` plugin, you have some options to {logstash-ref}/plugins-integrations-snmp.html#plugins-integrations-snmp-input-snmptrap-compat[preserve existing behavior].
