== Breaking changes

**Breaking changes in 5.0**

Application Settings: Introduced a new way to configure application settings for Logstash through a settings.yml file. This file 
is typically located in `LS_HOME/config`, or `/etc/logstash` when installed via packages. Logstash will not be able 
to start without this file, so please make sure to pass in `--path.settings` if you are starting Logstash manually 
after installing it via a package (RPM, DEB).

Release Packages: When Logstash is installed via DEB, RPM packages, it uses `/usr/share/logstash` and `/var/lib/logstash` to install binaries and config files 
respectively. Previously it used to install in `/opt` directory. This change was done to make the user experience 
consistent with other Elastic products. Full directory layout is described https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/5.0/dir-layout.html[here].

Command Line Interface: Most of the long form https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/5.0/command-line-flags.html[options] have been renamed 
to adhere to the yml dot notation to be used in the settings file. Short form options have not been changed.

Plugin Developers: The Event class has a https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/5141[new API] to access its data. You will no longer be able to directly use 
the Event class through the ruby hash paradigm. All the plugins packaged with Logstash has been updated 
to use the new API and their versions bumped to the next major.

The command `bin/plugin` has been renamed to `bin/logstash-plugin`. `bin/plugin <plugin>`` which is the current 
way of install packs/plugins is problematic because it pollutes the global namespace if it is put in the path. 
This command can now install both plugins and "Packs" - a single zip that contains 0 or 1 plugin for each system 
in the Elastic stack.

**Environment Variables Support in Configuration**
You can set environment variable references into Logstash plugins configuration using `${var}` or `$var` syntax.
Previously if you had used `${var}` or `$var` as a value in configuration, 5.0 will try to resolve it assuming 
it is an environment variable

== Kafka Input and Output Plugins

Kafka version 0.9 brings in new security features (SSL, client based auth, access control), 
improved consumer and producer API, and much more. For bringing in these features, Logstash 
had to use the new 0.9 version of the consumer which is not compatible with previous versions of the broker.
To use these new features, users have to first upgrade Kafka Brokers from 0.8.x to 0.9 and then use the 
input plugins. Please note that several configurations have changed in the Logstash configuration.
