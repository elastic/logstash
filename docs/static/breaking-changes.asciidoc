== Breaking Changes

We strive to maintain backward compatibility between minor versions (6.x to 6.y,
for example) so that you can upgrade without changing any configuration files.
Breaking changes are usually introduced only between major versions (such as 5.x
to 6.y). On occasion, we are forced to break compatibility within a given major release
to ensure correctness of operation.

This section covers the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating to
Logstash 6.0.0 and later.

NOTE: Migrating directly between non-consecutive major versions (1.x to
6.x) is not recommended.

See these topics for a description of breaking changes:

* <<breaking-pq>>
* <<breaking-6.0>>

See also <<releasenotes>>.

[[breaking-pq]]
=== Breaking change across PQ versions prior to Logstash 6.3.0

If you are upgrading from Logstash 6.2.x or any earlier version (including 5.x)
and have the persistent queue enabled, we strongly recommend that you drain or
delete the persistent queue before you upgrade. See <<upgrading-logstash-pqs>>
for information and instructions.

We are working to resolve issues with data incompatibilities so that additional
steps won't be required for future upgrades.

[[breaking-6.0]]
=== Breaking changes in 6.0

Here are the breaking changes for 6.0.

[float]
==== Changes in Logstash Core

These changes can impact any instance of Logstash and are plugin agnostic, but only if you are using the features that are impacted.

[float]
===== Application Settings

* The setting `config.reload.interval` has been changed to use time value strings such as `5m`, `10s` etc.
  Previously, users had to convert this to a millisecond time value themselves.

[float]
===== RPM/Deb package changes

* For `rpm` and `deb` release artifacts, config files that match the `*.conf` glob pattern must be in the conf.d folder,
  or the files will not be loaded.

[float]
===== Command Line Interface behavior

* The `-e` and `-f` CLI options are now mutually exclusive. This also applies to the corresponding long form options `config.string` and
  `path.config`. This means any configurations  provided via `-e` will no longer be appended to the configurations provided via `-f`.
* Configurations provided with `-f` or `config.path` will not be appended with `stdin` input and `stdout` output automatically.

[float]
==== Plugin Changes

[float]
===== Elasticsearch output changes

* The default `document_type` has changed from `logs` to `doc` for consistency with Beats.
  Furthermore, users are advised that Elasticsearch 6.0 deprecates doctypes, and 7.0 will remove them. 
  See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/removal-of-types.html[Removal of Mapping Types] for more info.
* The options `flush_size` and `idle_flush_time` are now obsolete.
* Please note that the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/mapping-all-field.html[_all] field is deprecated in 6.0.
 The new mapping template has been updated to reflect that. If you are using a custom mapping template you may need to update it to reflect that.

[float]
===== Kafka input changes

* Upgraded Kafka client support to v0.11.0.0, which only supports Kafka brokers v0.10.x or later.
** Please refer to <<plugins-inputs-kafka,Kafka input plugin>> documentation for information about Kafka compatibility with Logstash.
* Decorated fields are now nested under `@metadata` to avoid mapping conflicts with Beats.
** See the `Metadata Fields` section in the <<plugins-inputs-kafka,Kafka input plugin>> documentation for more details.
* The `ssl` option is now obsolete.

[float]
===== Kafka output changes

* Upgraded Kafka client support to v0.11.0.0, which only supports Kafka brokers v0.10.x or later.
** Please refer to <<plugins-outputs-kafka,Kafka output plugin>> documentation for information about Kafka compatibility with Logstash.
* The options `block_on_buffer_full`, `ssl`, and `timeout_ms` are now obsolete.

[float]
===== Beats input changes

* Logstash will no longer start when <<plugins-codecs-multiline,Multiline codec plugin>> is used with the Beats input plugin.
** It is recommended to use the multiline support in Filebeat as a replacement - see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/multiline-examples.html[configuration options available in Filebeat] for details.
* The options `congestion_threshold` and `target_field_for_codec` are now obsolete.

[float]
===== List of plugins bundled with Logstash

The following plugins were removed from the 6.0 default bundle based on usage data. You can still install these plugins manually:

* logstash-codec-oldlogstashjson
* logstash-input-couchdb_changes
* logstash-input-irc
* logstash-input-log4j
* logstash-input-lumberjack
* logstash-filter-uuid
* logstash-output-xmpp
* logstash-output-irc
* logstash-output-statsd
