== {es} security on by default

{es} generates its own default self-signed Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates at startup. 

{ls} must establish a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection before it can transfer data to a secured {es} cluster. 
{ls} must have a copy of the certificate authority (CA) that signed the {es} cluster's certificates.
When a new {es} cluster is started up _without_ dedicated certificates, it generates its own default self-signed Certificate Authority at startup.
See {ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[Starting the Elastic Stack with security enabled] for more info.
  
{ess} uses certificates signed by standard publicly trusted certificate authorities, and therefore setting a cacert is not necessary.

.Hosted {ess} simplifies security
[NOTE]
=====
Our hosted {ess} on Elastic Cloud simplifies safe, secure communication between {ls} and {es}. 
When you configure the elasticsearch output plugin to use <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-cloud_id,`cloud_id`>> with either the <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-cloud_auth,`cloud_auth` option>> or the <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-api_key,`api_key` option>>, no additional SSL configuration steps are needed.

Examples:

* `output {elasticsearch { cloud_id => "<cloud id>" cloud_auth => "<cloud auth>" } }`
* `output {elasticsearch { cloud_id => "<cloud id>" api_key => "<api key>" } }``

For more details, check out the
{logstash-ref}/connecting-to-cloud.html[Logstash-to-Cloud documentation].

[[es-security-onprem]]
=== Secure communication with an on-premise {es} cluster

If you are running {es} on your own hardware and using the Elasticsearch cluster's default self-signed certificates, you need to complete a few more steps to establish secure communication between {ls} and {es}.

You need to:

* Copy the self-signed CA certificate from {es} and save it to {ls}.
* Configure the elasticsearch-output plugin to use the certificate.

These steps are not necessary if your cluster is using public trusted certificates.

[[es-sec-copy-cert]]
==== Copy and save the certificate

By default an on-premise {es} cluster generates a self-signed CA and creates its own SSL certificates when it starts. 
Therefore {ls} needs its own copy of the self-signed CA from the {es} cluster in order for {ls} to validate the certificate presented by {es}.

Copy the {ref}/configuring-stack-security.html#stack-security-certificates[self-signed CA certificate] from the {es} `config/certs` directory.

Save it to a location that Logstash can access, such as `config/certs` on the {ls} instance. 

/////
ToDo: 
Verify location. 
I don't see an existing config/certs folder. 
If this is the location we'd like users to use, we should stub out a folder in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/main/config. 
As always, there's a definite argument for consistency across deployments.

==== Configure the elasticsearch output

Use the <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,`elasticsearch output`'s>> <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-cacert,`cacert` option>> to point to the certificate's location. 

**Example**

[source,ruby] 
-------
output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["https://...] <1>
    cacert => '/etc/logstash/config/certs/ca.crt' <2>
  }
}
-------
<1> Note that the `hosts` url must begin with `https` 
<2> Path to the {ls} copy of the {es} certificate

For more information about establishing secure communication with {es}, see {ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[security is on by default].
