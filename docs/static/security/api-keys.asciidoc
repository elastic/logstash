==== Grant access using API keys


Instead of using usernames and passwords, you can use API keys to grant
access to {es} resources. You can set API keys to expire at a certain time,
and you can explicitly invalidate them. Any user with the `manage_api_key`
or `manage_own_api_key` cluster privilege can create API keys.
