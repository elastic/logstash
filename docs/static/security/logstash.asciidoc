The Logstash {es} {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html[output],
{logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-elasticsearch.html[input], and
{logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-elasticsearch.html[filter] plugins,  as well as
{logstash-ref}/monitoring-logstash.html[monitoring] and central management,
support authentication and encryption over HTTPS.

{es} clusters are secured by default (starting in 8.0). 
You need to configure authentication credentials for Logstash in order to
establish communication.
Logstash throws an exception and the processing pipeline is halted if authentication fails.

In addition to configuring authentication credentials for Logstash, you need
to grant authorized users permission to access the Logstash indices.

Security is enabled by default on the {es} cluster (starting in 8.0).
You must enable TLS/SSL in the {es} output section of the Logstash configuration in order to allow Logstash to communicate with the {es} cluster.
