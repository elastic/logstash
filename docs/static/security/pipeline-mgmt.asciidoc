=== Configuring credentials for Centralized Pipeline Management

If you plan to use Logstash
{logstash-ref}/logstash-centralized-pipeline-management.html[centralized pipeline management],
you need to configure the username and password that Logstash uses for managing
configurations.

You configure the user and password in the `logstash.yml` configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------
xpack.management.elasticsearch.username: logstash_admin_user <1>
xpack.management.elasticsearch.password: t0p.s3cr3t
----------------------------------------------------------
<1> The user you specify here must have the built-in `logstash_admin` role as
well as the `logstash_writer` role that you created earlier.
