=== Logstash-to-Logstash communication

{ls}-to-{ls} communication is available if you need to have one {ls} instance communicate with another {ls} instance. 
Implementing Logstash-to-Logstash communication can add complexity to your environment, but you may need it if the data path crosses network or firewall boundaries. 
However, we suggest you don't implement unless it is strictly required.

NOTE: If you are looking for information on connecting multiple pipelines within
one Logstash instance, see <<pipeline-to-pipeline>>.

Logstash-to-Logstash communication can be achieved in one of two ways: 

* <<ls-to-ls-lumberjack>>
* <<ls-to-ls-http>>
