  title: Logstash APIs
  description: |
    When you run Logstash, it automatically captures runtime metrics that you can use to monitor the health and performance of your Logstash deployment.
    The metrics collected by Logstash include:
    
    - Logstash node info, like pipeline settings, OS info, and JVM info.
    - Plugin info, including a list of installed plugins.
    - Node stats, like JVM stats, process stats, event-related stats, and pipeline runtime stats.
    - Hot threads.

    The APIs that retrieve these metrics are available by default without requiring any extra configuration.
