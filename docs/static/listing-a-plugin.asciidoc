[[plugin-listing]]
=== List your plugin

The {logstash-ref}[Logstash Reference] is the first place {ls} users look for plugins and documentation. 
If your plugin meets the <<plugin-acceptance,quality and acceptance guidelines>>, we may be able to list it in the guide.

The plugin source and readme will continue to live in your repo, and we will direct users there. 

If you would like to have your plugin included in the {logstash-ref}[Logstash Reference]: 

* verify that it meets our <<plugin-acceptance,quality and acceptance guidelines>>
* create a new https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/issues[issue] in the Logstash repository. 
** Use `PluginListing: <yourpluginname>` as the title for the issue.
** Apply the `docs` label.  
** In the body of the issue, explain the purpose and value your plugin offers, and describe how this plugin adheres to the guidelines.
