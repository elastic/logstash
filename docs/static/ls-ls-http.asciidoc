=== Logstash-to-Logstash: HTTP output to HTTP input

HTTP output to HTTP input is an alternative to the Lumberjack output to Beats input approach for Logstash-to-Logstash communication. 
This approach relies on the use of <<plugins-outputs-http,http output>> to <<plugins-inputs-http,http input>> plugins.

NOTE: Check out these <<http-considerations,considerations>> before you implement {ls}-to-{ls} using HTTP. 

For now, <<plugins-outputs-http,http output>> to <<plugins-inputs-http,http input>> with manual configuration may be the best path forward if these limitations don't apply to your use case.
