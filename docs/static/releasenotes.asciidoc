[[logstash-6-1-3]]
=== Logstash 6.1.3 Release Notes

* Fix bug where with terminating input plugins in-memory queue might not be drained. This could happen in some situations with inputs like the stdin input or the Elasticsearch input. This could result in some messages not being processed.
* Correctly handle paths with spaces on Windows. See https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/8931[#8931] for details.

==== Plugins

*Multiline Codec*

* Fixed concurrency issue causing random failures when multiline codec was used together with a multi-threaded input plugin

*CSV Filter*

* Added support for tagging empty rows which users can reference to conditionally drop events

*Elasticsearch Filter*

* If elasticsearch response contains a shard failure, then tag_on_failure tags are added to Logstash event
* Enhancement : add support for nested fields
* Enhancement : add 'docinfo_fields' option
* Enhancement : add 'aggregation_fields' option

*Elasticsearch Input*

* Add support for scheduling periodic execution of the query

*RabbitMQ Input/Output*

* Output Only: Use shared concurrency / multiple channels for performance

*HTTP Output*

* Added json_batch format
