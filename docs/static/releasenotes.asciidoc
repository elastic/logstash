[[logstash-6-2-3]]
=== Logstash 6.2.3 Release Notes

* There are no changes to Logstash core in this release

==== Plugins

*Fluent codec*

* Added ability to encode tags as fluent forward protocol tags

*Netflow codec*

* Improved decoding performance of ASA ACL ids, MAC addresses and IPv4 addresses

*KV Filter*

*Syslog Input*

* Changed syslog field to be a configurable option. This is useful for when codecs change the field containing the syslog data.

* Changed sniffing behavior to connect only to `http.enabled` nodes that serve data for Elasticsearch 5.x and 6.x. Master-only nodes are ignored.
  (For Elasticsearch 1.x and 2.x, any nodes with `http.enabled` are added to the hosts lists, including master-only nodes.)

[[logstash-6-2-2]]

* Added support to protect sensitive settings and configuration in a {logstash-ref}/keystore.html[keystore].
* Added the {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-jdbc_static.html[jdbc_static filter] as a default plugin.
* Set better defaults to allow for higher throughput under load. (https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/8707[#8707] and https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/8702[#8702])
* Set the default configuration for RPM/DEB/Docker installations to use {logstash-ref}/multiple-pipelines.html[Multiple pipelines].
* Added a default max size value (100MB) for log files.
* Added compression when log files are rolled (for ZIP-based installs).
* Added the ability to specify `--pipeline.id` from the command line. (https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/8868[#8868])
* Implemented continued improvements to the next generation of execution. Give it a try with the command line switch `--experimental-java-execution`.

==== Plugins

*Jdbc_static Filter*

* Released the initial version the {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-jdbc_static.html[jdbc_static filter], which enriches events with data pre-loaded from a remote database.

*Dissect Filter*

* Fixed multiple bugs. See the plugin release notes for https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-dissect/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#113[1.1.3].

*Kafka Output*

* Improved error logging for when a producer cannot be created.

[[logstash-6-1-3]]
=== Logstash 6.1.3 Release Notes

* Correctly handle paths with spaces on Windows. See https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/8931[#8931] for details.

==== Plugins

*Multiline Codec*

* Fixed concurrency issue causing random failures when multiline codec was used together with a multi-threaded input plugin

*CSV Filter*

* Enhancement : add support for nested fields
* Enhancement : add 'docinfo_fields' option
* Enhancement : add 'aggregation_fields' option

*Elasticsearch Input*

* Add support for scheduling periodic execution of the query

*RabbitMQ Input/Output*

* Bug Fix: undefined method `value' for nil:NilClass with SSL enabled, but no certificates provided
* Output Only: Use shared concurrency / multiple channels for performance

*HTTP Output*

* Added json_batch format
* Make 429 responses log at debug, not error level. They are really just flow control


[[logstash-6-1-2]]
