[[logstash-5-6-13]]
=== Logstash 5.6.13 Release Notes

* Make cgroups support more robust and provide the override similar to ES ({lsissue}/10012[#10010]).

[[logstash-5-6-12]]
=== Logstash 5.6.12 Release Notes

*Multiline Codec*

* Fixed `no method map_cleanup for nil class` error when shutting down.

*Rubydebug Codec*

* Fixed crash that could occur on startup if `$HOME` was unset or if `${HOME}/.aprc` was unreadable by pinning `awesome_print` dependency to a release before the bug was introduced.

*Clone Filter*

* Added a warning when 'clones' is empty since that results in a no-op.

*Dns Filter*

* Fixed JRuby resolver bug for versions prior to 9.1.16.0

*Mutate Filter*

* Changed documentation to clarify use of `replace` config option

*Ruby Filter*

* Fixed path based scripting not calling `filter_matched`

*Beats Input*

* Fixed handling of batches where the sequence numbers do not start with 1

*Exec Input*

* Fixed issue where certain log entries were incorrectly writing 'jdbc input' instead of 'exec input'

*Jdbc Input*

* Changed documentation to generalize the PATH location
* Added check to prevent count sql syntax errors when debug logging
* Fixed crash that occurs when receiving string input that cannot be coerced to UTF-8 (such as BLOB data)
* Swapped out mysql for postgresql for testing

* Fixed error in documentation by removing illegal commas

*Udp Input*

* Fixed input workers exception handling and shutdown handling

*File Output*

* Fixed a bug introduced in v4.2.4 where events on low-volume pipelines could remain unflushed for long periods when `flush_interval` was non-zero
* Fixed a bug where flush interval was being called for each event when enabled

*Graphite Output*

* Fixed exception handling during socket writing to prevent logstash termination

*S3 Output*

[[logstash-5-6-11]]
=== Logstash 5.6.11 Release Notes

* Check free space for PQ on specified path rather than root folder

[[logstash-5-6-10]]
=== Logstash 5.6.10 Release Notes
* Backport new PQ implementation

*Kv Filter*

* bugfix: improves trim_key and trim_value to trim any sequence of matching characters from the beginning and ends of the corresponding keys and values; a previous implementation limited trim to a single character from each end, which was surprising.
* bugfix: fixes issue where we can fail to correctly break up a sequence that includes a partially-quoted value followed by another fully-quoted value by slightly reducing greediness of quoted-value captures.

*Mutate Filter*

* Fix: when converting to float and float_eu, explicitly support same range of inputs as their integer counterparts; eliminates a regression introduced in 3.3.1 in which support for non-string inputs was inadvertently removed.

* Log entry when bucket is empty #150
* Symbolize hash keys for additional_settings hash #148

[[logstash-5-6-1]]
=== Logstash 5.6.1 Release Notes

* There are no user-facing changes in this release

[[logstash-5-6-0]]
=== Logstash 5.6.0 Release Notes

* Introduced modules for Netflow and ArcSight data. Modules contain pre-packaged Logstash configuration, Kibana dashboards
  and other metadata files to ease the set up of the Elastic stack for certain data sources. The goal of these modules are
  to provide an end-to-end, 5-min getting started experience for a user exploring a data source.
* Added a new setting called `config.support_escapes`. This setting enables the use of escape characters such as `\n` in
  the Logstash configuration.
* Improved the performance of metrics collection and reporting infrastructure. Overall, in this release, there is lower load
  average, less GC and higher throughput when running Logstash.
* When processing events from the DLQ, there are added checks now to stop them from being written to the DLQ again.
* Fixed an issue which would crash Logstash when accessing DLQ events using a timestamp range.

==== Filter Plugins

*`GeoIP`*: The free GeoIPLite2-ASN database from MaxMind is now bundled in Logstash to be able to look up ASN data out
  of the box.
