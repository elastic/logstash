=== Logstash 5.4.0 Release Notes

* The persistent queues feature is generally available (GA) now. The beta tag has been removed.
* The `dissect` filter is now bundled in the Logstash artifact.
* Updated the `line` and `multiline` codecs to be threadsafe when used with inputs.
* Logstash's plugin manager now works when an HTTP proxy is used ({lsissue}6619[Issue 6619], {lsissue}6528[Issue 6528]).
* On Windows deployments, we now search for the java executable in `%PATH%` which works well for 
  the latest JDK 8 updates.
