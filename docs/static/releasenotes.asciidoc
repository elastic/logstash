=== Logstash 6.0.0-beta1 Release Notes

Placeholder for beta1 release notes

* Added new `logstash.yml` setting: `config.support_escapes`. When
  enabled, Logstash will interpret escape sequences in strings in the pipeline
  configuration.


[[logstash-6-0-0-alpha2]]
=== Logstash 6.0.0-alpha2 Release Notes

* Breaking: Currently, when Logstash is installed and set up via package managers, it loads all files found 
  in `/etc/logstash/conf.d` as configuration. This can be problematic if there are non-configuration files in this 
  folder. Starting from alpha2, Logstash will only glob files ending with `.conf` extension in `/etc/logstash/conf.d` ({lsissue}6979)[Issue 6979)]).
* Added support for running multiple pipelines in the same Logstash instance. Running multiple pipelines 
  allow users to isolate data flow, provide separate runtime pipeline parameters and helps simplify complex 
  configurations.
* A new `pipelines.yml` configuration file has been added to define pipelines.

[[logstash-6-0-0-alpha1]]
=== Logstash 6.0.0-alpha1 Release Notes

* Introducing a new internal representation for the existing Logstash configuration that forms the 
  foundation of many new features. This is not a breaking change, and existing configs will work as is.
