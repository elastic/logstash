[[logstash-5-5-0]]
=== Logstash 5.5.0 Release Notes

* Introduced a new feature called dead letter queues. When enabled, the dead letter queue (DLQ) feature will route 
  events to a file-based store when the output plugin is unable to process the events. Currently, the Elasticsearch 
  output is the only plugin that uses this feature to store "dead" events that result from Elasticsearch mapping errors.
* Upgraded to JRuby version 1.7.27.
* Set the default entropy source to `/dev/urandom`. This change resolves an issue that caused Logstash to 
  stall on startup for several minutes. This stall behavior was especially visible when Logstash was 
  deployed on VMs ({lsissue}6117[Issue 6117]).
* Added support to resolve environment variables specified in the `logstash.yml` file ({lsissue}6785[Issue 6785]).
* Fixed the ability to change log levels via the API ({lsissue}7277[Issue 7277]).

[float]
==== Filter Plugins

*`Date`*:

* A warning message is no longer logged when `ISO8601` format and timezone interpolation is used (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-date/issues/97[#97]).

*`Mutate`*:

* Added a new copy option that allows users to clone a field into a new field target.
