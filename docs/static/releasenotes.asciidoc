== Release Notes

This section summarizes the changes in 5.0.0 release.

List of <<breaking-changes, breaking changes>>

[float]
==== General

* A new monitoring feature provides runtime visibility into the Logstash pipeline and its plugins. This component 
collects various kinds of operational metrics while Logstash processes your data, and all of this information 
can be queried using simple APIs. Please refer to <<monitoring>> for details.
* Improved throughput performance across the board (up by 2x in some configs) by implementing Event 
representation in Java. Event is the main object that encapsulates data as it flows through 
Logstash and provides APIs for the plugins to perform processing. This change also enables 
faster serialization for future persistence work ({lsissue}4191[Issue 4191]).
* Breaking Change: Renamed filenames for Debian and RPM artifacts to match Elasticsearch's naming scheme. The metadata is 
still the same, so upgrades will not be affected. Please refer to the new <<deb-layout, directory structure>>. If you have 
automated downloads for Logstash, please make sure you use the updated URLs ({lsissue}5100[Issue 5100]).
* Introduced a new way to configure application settings for Logstash through a `logstash.yml` file. This
file is typically located in `LS_HOME/config` or `/etc/logstash` when installed via packages. Logstash will
not be able to start without this file, so please make sure to pass in `path.settings` if you are starting
Logstash manually after installing it via a package (RPM or DEB) ({lsissue}4401[Issue 4401]).
* Breaking Change: Most of the long form CLI options have been renamed to match the settings defined in `logstash.yml`.
* Breaking Change: For plugin developers, the Event class has a new API to access its data. You will no longer be able to
directly use the Event class through the Ruby hash paradigm. All the plugins packaged with Logstash have
been updated to use the new API, and their versions have been bumped to the next major. Please refer to <<event-api>> for details ({lsissue}5141[Issue 5141]).
* Breaking Change: Environment variables inside the Logstash config are evaluated by default. There is no need to specify the
`--allow-env` feature flag.
* Breaking Change: Renamed `bin/plugin` to `bin/logstash-plugin`. This is to prevent `PATH` being polluted when other 
components of the Elastic Stack are installed on the same instance ({lsissue}4891[Issue 4891]).
* Added support for `DEBUG=1` when running any plugin-related commands. This option gives more information that is useful when debugging 
unexpected behavior in `bin/logstash-plugin`
* Logging Changes: Migrated Logstash's internal logging framework to Log4j2. This enhancement provides the following features:
** Support for changing the <<logging>> level dynamically at runtime through REST endpoints. New APIs have been exposed
under `_node/logging` to update log levels. You can also list all existing loggers by sending a `GET` request to this API.
** Configurable file rotation policy for logs. The default is per-day.
** Support for component-level or plugin-level log settings.
** Unified logging across Logstash's Java and Ruby code.
** Logs are now placed in the `LS_HOME/logs` directory, which is configurable via the `path.logs` setting. For deb/rpm packages 
logs are placed in `/var/log/logstash/` by default.
** Changed the default log severity level to `INFO` instead of `WARN` to match Elasticsearch.
** Logstash can now emit its log in structured, JSON format. Specify log.format=json` in the settings file 
or via the command line ({lsissue}1569[Issue 1569]).
* Added support for systemd and upstart so you can now manage Logstash as a service on most Linux distributions ({lsissue}5012[Issue 5012]).
* Fixed a bug where Logstash would not shutdown if CTRL-C was used while using stdin input in the 
configuration ({lsissue}1769[Issue 1769]).
* Created a new `LS_HOME/data` directory to store plugin states, Logstash instance UUID, and more. This directory 
location is configurable via the `path.data` setting in the `logstash.yml` <<logstash-settings-file,settings file>> ({lsissue}5404[Issue 5404]).
* Made `bin/logstash -V/--version` run faster on Unix platforms.
* Introduced a performance optimization called bi-values to store both JRuby and Java object types. This optimization
benefits plugins written in Ruby.
* Show meaningful error messages for unknown CLI commands ({lsissue}5748[Issue 5748]).
* Added ability to configure custom garbage collection log file using `$LS_LOG_DIR`.
* Plugin Developers: Improved nomenclature and methods for 'threadsafe' outputs. Removed the `workers_not_supported` method ({lsissue}5662[Issue 5662]).

==== Input Plugins

*`Beats`*:

* Improved throughput performance by reimplementing the beats input plugin in Java and using Netty, an asynchronous I/O
library. These changes resulted in up to 50% gains in throughput performance while preserving the original plugin
functionality (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/92[Issue 92]).

*`JDBC`*:

* Added the `charset` config option to support setting the character encoding for strings that are not in UTF-8 format.
You can use the `columns_charset` option to override this encoding setting for individual columns 
(https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-jdbc/issues/143[Issue 143]).

*`Kafka`*:

* Added support for Kafka broker 0.10. This plugin now supports SSL based encryption. This release 
changed a lot of configuration, so it is not backward compatible. Also, this version will not work 
with older Kafka brokers.

*`HTTP`*:

* Fixed a bug where the HTTP input plugin blocked the node stats API (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/issues/51[Issue 51]). 

*`HTTP Poller`*:

* Added meaningful error messages for missing trust store/keystore passwords. Also documented the creation of a custom keystore.

*`RabbitMQ`*:

* Removed `verify_ssl` option, which was never used previously. To validate SSL certs, use the `ssl_certificate_path` and `ssl_certificate_password` config options (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-rabbitmq/issues/82[Issue 82]).

*`Stdin`*: 

* This plugin is now non-blocking, so you can use CTRL-C to stop Logstash.

*`Elasticsearch`*:

* This plugin is now compatible with Elasticsearch 5.0.0. Scan search type has been replaced by scroll.

[float]
==== Filter Plugins

*`Grok`*:

* Added support to cancel long-running execution. Many times users write runaway regular expressions that lead to a
stalled Logstash. You can configure `timeout_millis` to cancel the current execution and continue processing the event
downstream (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-grok/issues/82[Issue 82]).
* Added a stats counter on grok matches and failures. This is exposed in the `_node/stats/pipeline` endpoint.

*`Date`*:

* Added a stats counter on grok matches and failures. This is exposed in the `_node/stats/pipeline` endpoint.

*`GeoIP`*:

* Added support for the GeoIP2 city database and support for IPv6 lookups (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-geoip/issues/23[Issue 23]).

*`DNS`*:

* Improved performance by adding caches to both successful and failed requests.
* Added support for retrying with the `:max_retries` setting.
* Lowered the default value of timeout from 2 to 0.5 seconds.

*`CSV`*:

* Added the `autodetect_column_names` option to read column names from the header.

*`XML`*:

* Breaking Change: Added a new configuration called `suppress_empty`, which defaults to true. This changes the
default behaviour of the plugin in favor of avoiding mapping conflicts when reaching Elasticsearch (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-xml/issues/24[Issue 24]).
* Added a new configuration called `force_content`. By default, the filter expands attributes differently
for content in XML elements. This option allows you to force text content and attributes to always parse to
a hash value (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-xml/issues/14[Issue 14]).
* Fixed a bug that ensures that a `target` is set when storing XML content in the event (`store_xml => true`).

[float]
==== Output Plugins

*`Elasticsearch`*:

* Breaking Change: The index template for 5.0 has been changed to reflect Elasticsearch's mapping changes. Most importantly,
the subfield for string multi-fields has changed from `.raw` to `.keyword` to match Elasticsearch's default behavior
(https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/386[Issue 386]). See <<breaking-changes>> for details about how this change affects new and existing users.
* Added `check_connection_timeout` parameter, which has a default of 10m.
* Added the ability for the plugin to choose which default template to use based on the Elasticsearch version (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/401[Issue 401]).
* Elasticserach output is now fully threadsafe. This means internal resources can be shared among multiple
`output { elasticsearch {} }` instances.
* Added sniffing improvements so any current connections don't have to be closed/reopened after a sniff round.
* Introduced a connection pool to reuse connections to Elasticsearch backends.
* Added exponential backoff to connection retries with a ceiling of `retry_max_interval`, which is the most time to 
wait between retries, and `retry_initial_interval`,  which is the initial amount of time to wait. The value of
`retry_initial_interval` increases exponentially between retries until a request succeeds.
* Added support for specifying ingest pipelines (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/410[Issue 410]).

*`Tcp`*:

* Added SSL/TLS support for certificate-based encryption.

*`Kafka`*:

* Made this output a shareable instance across multiple pipeline workers. This ensures efficient use of resources like broker
TCP connections, internal producer buffers, and so on.
