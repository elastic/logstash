== Release Notes

This section summarizes the changes in the following releases:

* <<logstash-5-1-2,Logstash 5.1.2>>
* <<logstash-5-1-1,Logstash 5.1.1>>
* <<logstash-5-1-0,Logstash 5.1.0>>

[[logstash-5-1-2]]
=== Logstash 5.1.2 Release Notes

* Restored the ability to remove `tags` fields from events. In versions 5.0.1 and 5.1.1, `tags` fields could not be 
  removed because of a side effect from another related change ({lsissue}6429[Issue 6429], {lsissue}6384[Issue 6384]).
* Corrected the slowlog field `took_in_millis` to report duration in milliseconds instead of microseconds ({lsissue}6476[Issue 6476]).

[[logstash-5-1-1]]
=== Logstash 5.1.1 Release Notes

* Persistent queues is a new beta feature that provides infrastructure in Logstash for buffering event data to disk. 
  By default, Logstash still uses an in-memory, bounded queue between the input and filter stages without any guarantees 
  for data delivery. Users can now opt-in to enable disk-based persistence that can prevent event loss in certain 
  scenarios. The setting `queue.type: persisted` enables this feature ({lsissue}2605[Issue 2605], {lsissue}2606[Issue 2606]).
* Filters can be configured to log event data and related context when filter execution exceeds a specified time threshold. 
  These slowlogs will be collected in a separate file called `logstash-slowlog-plain-YYYY-MM-dd.log` ({lsissue}5733[Issue 5733]).
* Added two new fields `id`, and `name` to the base metadata for API requests. The `id` field is the persisted 
  UUID. The `name` field is the custom name the user has passed in (defaults to the hostname).
* The `_node/stats` API will now report uptime in milliseconds ({lsissue}6214[Issue 6214]).
* Enhanced the `/_node/stats` API to report the CPU load average information. Load average stats are not reported 
  on Windows ({lsissue}6215[Issue 6215]).
* Fixed heap dump path for Windows installs.
* When using the JSON logging format, exception messages are now handled correctly ({lsissue}6082[Issue 6082]).
* We now log an error message when a plugin specified in the config is not found in the installed list ({lsissue}6020[Issue 6020]).

==== Input Plugins

*`Beats`*:

* The `congestion_threshold` configuration is now deprecated as the new Java implementation uses an alternate keep-alive 
  mechanism.
* Fixed an issue where data shipped in intervals greater than five seconds could cause the connection between 
  Filebeat and Logstash to be closed (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/163[Issue 163]).

*`Kafka`*:

* Added Kerberos authentication support (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-kafka/issues/124[Issue 124]).

*`Syslog`*:

* Added support for proxy protocol ({lsissue}4418[Issue 4418]).

*`TCP`*:

* Added support for proxy protocol ({lsissue}4418[Issue 4418]).

*`UDP`*:

* Added `receive_buffer_bytes` config setting to optionally set the socket receive buffer size. Allowing a user to set this 
  can prevent data loss on uneven traffic flow (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-udp/issues/22[Issue 22]).

*`RabbitMQ`*

* A dropped connection between Logstash and RabbitMQ is now re-tried when an intermediary proxy reports 
  that there are no live backends (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-rabbitmq/issues/76[#76])

==== Filter Plugins

*`Grok`*:

* The timeout enforcer can now be disabled by setting `timeout_millis` to nil. The default for `timeout_millis` 
  is now 30s (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-grok/issues/99[Issue 99]).

*`Date`*:

* Improved performance: The date filter is now 2.8x faster for common case (first pattern matches), and 14x faster for 
  events where multiple patterns are attempted (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-date/issues/74[Issue 74]).

==== Output Plugins

*`Elasticsearch`*:

* A health check is now performed against Elasticsearch hosts right after startup and sniffing for the first 
  time. Previously, a health check was issued after an error was received from a request (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/507[Issue 507]).
* You can now specify event dependent configuration when configuring the ingest pipeline (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/491[Issue 491]).

[[logstash-5-1-0]]
=== Logstash 5.1.0 Release Notes (Skipped)

* Version 5.1.0 doesnâ€™t exist because, for a short period of time, the Elastic Yum and Apt repositories included 
  unreleased binaries labeled 5.1.0. To avoid confusion and upgrade issues for the people that have installed 
  these without realizing, we decided to skip the 5.1.0 version and release 5.1.1 instead.
