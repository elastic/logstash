[[logstash-2-4-1]]

==== Input Plugins

*`Beats`*:

* The plugin now accepts a specific host to bind to in the `host` config (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/146[Issue 146]).
* Fix an issue when forcing a logstash shutdown that could result in an InterruptedException (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/145[Issue 145]).
* Fix an issue when only the first CA found in the certificate authorities was taking into consideration to verify clients (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/153[Issue 153]).
* Validate the presence of ssl_certificate_authorities when verify_mode is set to FORCE_PEER or peer (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/155[Issue 155]).
* Fixed a typo in the default ciphers suite, added validations for the configured ciphers (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/156[Issue 156]).

*`HTTP Poller`*:

* Use rufus scheduler to support more flexible scheduling options to poll end-points (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http_poller/issues/60[Issue 60]).

*`RabbitMQ`*:

* Fix reconnection issues
* Include URL of server when logging errors
* Add warning log when connection is severed
* Retry the connection attempt if there is an IO Exception.

[[logstash-2-4]]
=== Logstash 2.4 Release Notes

* Backported the Event get/set API. These changes enable Logstash 2.4 to install plugins 
  that use the 5.0 API ({lsissue}5449[Issue 5449]).
* Added support for writing Logstash's logs in JSON format. You can use the command-line flag 
  `--log-in-json` to specify that Logstash write its own logs in JSON ({lsissue}1569[Issue 1569]).
* Plugin Generator: Added a subcommand `generate` to `bin/logstash-plugin`. This 
  bootstraps a new plugin with the correct directory structure and all the required files (templates).

==== Input Plugins

*`Beats`*:

* Beats input has been reimplemented using Netty, an asynchronous IO framework for Java. 
  This rewrite for performance brings the plugin in line with the Logstash Forwarder + LS combination 
  (https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/issues/92[Issue 92]).
