=== Logstash 7.15.2 Release Notes

[[known-issue-7-15-2]]
==== Known issue

Release 7.15.2 includes filter versions that will not run on JDK 8.
This issue is fixed in the latest versions: 

* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash-versioned-plugins/current/v3.1.12-plugins-filters-date.html[date filter 3.1.12]
* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash-versioned-plugins/current/v7.2.7-plugins-filters-geoip.html[geoip filter 7.2.7]

You can <<updating-plugins,update these plugins>> as usual:

[source,sh]
-----
bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-date
bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-geoip
-----

TIP: Clear the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to run Logstash with the bundled JDK (currently JDK 11). 
This approach is recommended and can help you avoid version incompatibilities. 

[[notable-7-15-2]]
==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed

**Jruby-openssl upgrade.** We've upgraded {ls} to 0.11.0 to properly support
alt-chain certificate verifications in plugins using the Ruby net/http stack.
The recent Let's Encrypt "DST Root CA X3" expiration has caused issues in
Logstash plugins such as S3.
We're including the upstream fix to avoid these issues and support alternate
chain TLS certificate verification.

[[logstash-7-13-0]]
=== Logstash 7.13.0 Release Notes

[[featured-7-13-0]]
==== New features and enhancements

===== Progress toward Elastic Common Schema (ECS)
In this release, we've made more Logstash plugins compatible with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS). This release builds on ECS work in previous releases, and adds ECS-compatibility for these plugins:

* {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-file.html[File input]
* {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-stdin.html[Stdin input] 
* {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-syslog.html[Syslog input] 
* {logstash-ref}/plugins-codecs-cef.html[Cef codec] 
* {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-clone.html[Clone filter]
* {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-geoip.html[Geoip filter] 
* {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-syslog_pri.html[Syslog_pri filter] 
* {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-tld.html[Tld filter] 

ECS compatibility is off-by-default in Logstash 7.x, but will be on-by-default in Logstash 8.0.

===== Elasticsearch datastreams
The {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html[Elasticsearch output plugin] now supports {ref}/data-streams.html[Elasticsearch data streams]. 
You can use the plugin to send time series datasets (such as logs, events, and metrics) as well as non-time series data to Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch data streams store append-only time series data across multiple indices while giving you a single named resource for requests. Data streams are well-suited for logs, events, metrics, and other continuously generated data.

The Elasticsearch output offers {logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-data-streams[data stream options] that are designed for indexing time series datasets into Elasticsearch.

[[logstash-7-12-0]]
=== Logstash 7.12.0 Release Notes

==== Security update

**Certificate verification with internal monitoring.** We fixed a bug in the
monitoring pipeline that caused it to pass monitoring data to {es} with
certificate verification disabled. {ls} internal monitoring had been sending
monitoring metadata (such as pipeline throughput metrics) to {es} without
verifying the recipient.
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12749[#12749]

For information: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22138[CVE-2021-22138].

==== New features and enhancements

===== Progress toward Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

We've done more work to help ease your transition to Elastic Common Schema
(ECS). This release extends ECS work in previous releases. Here's a recap:

* ECS support in Elasticsearch output plugin (7.9). The elasticsearch output
plugin can manage index templates that are compatible with ECS. For more info, see
{logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#_compatibility_with_the_elastic_common_schema_ecs[Compatibility
with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].

* Pipeline level ECS compatibility (7.10). The `pipeline.ecs_compatibility`
setting lets users control ECS compatibility for all plugins in a pipeline at
once instead of configuring each instance manually. This setting lets users lock
in a specific behavior in advance of their next major version upgrade.

ECS compatibility is off-by-default in Logstash 7.x, but will be on-by-default
in Logstash 8.0.

====== ECS-compliant grok patterns

The {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-grok.html[grok filter plugin] offers a new
set of patterns to make event field names ECS-compliant. (No worries if you're
not ready to transition yet. The complete set of legacy patterns is still
available and continues to be the default for Logstash 7.x.)

The ECS pattern set has an equivalent for each pattern in the legacy set, and is
a drop-in replacement.
Use the {logstash-ref}/plugins-filters-grok.html#plugins-filters-grok-ecs_compatibility[ecs_compatibility]
setting when you're ready to switch modes.

====== ECS-compliant beats input

The {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-beats.html[beats input plugin] is now
ECS-compliant. It adds two fields related to the event: the deprecated host
which contains the hostname, and the ip_address containing the remote address of
the client’s connection. When
{logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-beats.html#plugins-inputs-beats-ecs_compatibility[ECS
compatibility mode] is enabled these fields are moved to ECS-compatible
namespace.

===== JDK 15 support

Logstash introduces support for JDK 15!  You need to update settings in
`jvm.options` and `log4j2.properties` if:

* you are upgrading from Logstash 7.11.x (or earlier) to 7.12 or later, AND
* you are using JDK 15 or later.

Unless both of these conditions apply, you don't need to adjust settings because
of the upgrade.  See <<jdk15-upgrade,Using JDK 15>> for more information.

===== Conditional settings for JVM versions

We've added support for conditional settings and behavior, dependent on the JVM
version. Now you can configure different settings for different JVM versions.
Here is an example from the default `jvm.options` file.

Example:
```
## GC configuration
8-13:-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
8-13:-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=75
8-13:-XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly
```
This example sets garbage collection (GC) values for JDK 8-13 only. Those
settings don't apply to JVM 14 and above.

This feature is available for any setting in the `jvm.options` file, and aligns
more closely with the {es} implementation of jvm settings.

===== Aarch64 (ARM64) support for Linux (beta)

Support for 64-bit ARM architectures on Linux is now in beta, with downloadable artifacts and docker images available.

==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed

**Pipeline loading and monitoring improvements**

We've made changes to start the webserver that exposes the Logstash metrics API earlier in the startup process.
For slow starting pipelines, this would cause error messages to appear in the Logstash logs, and cause delays to
the availability of the metrics API. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12571[#12571]

**Windows startup fixes**

We've fixed an issue where Logstash would crash when attempting to start using the bundled JDK when Logstash was located
in a folder where the folder name contained spaces https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12585[#12585]

*S3 Output - 4.3.3*

* [DOC] Update links to use shared attributes https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-s3/pull/230[#230]

*Core Patterns - 4.3.0*

With **4.3.0** we're introducing a new set of pattern definitions compliant with Elastic Common Schema (ECS), on numerous
places patterns are capturing names prescribed by the schema or use custom namespaces that do not conflict with ECS ones.

Changes are backwards compatible as much as possible and also include improvements to some of the existing patterns.

Besides fields having new names, values for numeric (integer or floating point) types are usually converted to their
numeric representation to ease further event processing (e.g. `http.response.status_code` is now stored as an integer).

NOTE: to leverage the new ECS pattern set in Logstash a grok filter upgrade to version >= 4.4.0 is required.

- **aws**
  * in ECS mode we dropped the (incomplete) attempt to capture `rawrequest` from `S3_REQUEST_LINE`
  * `S3_ACCESS_LOG` will handle up-to-date S3 access-log formats (6 'new' field captures at the end)
    Host Id -> Signature Version -> Cipher Suite -> Authentication Type -> Host Header -> TLS version
  * `ELB_ACCESS_LOG` will handle optional (`-`) in legacy mode
  * null values such as `-` or `-1` time values (e.g. `ELB_ACCESS_LOG`'s `request_processing_time`)
    are not captured in ECS mode

- **bacula**
* Fix: improve matching of `BACULA_HOST` as `HOSTNAME`
* Fix: legacy `BACULA_` patterns to handle (optional) spaces
* Fix: handle `BACULA_LOG` 'Job Id: X' prefix as optional
* Fix: legacy matching of BACULA fatal error lines

- **bind**
* `BIND9`'s legacy `querytype` was further split into multiple fields as:
     `dns.question.type` and `bind.log.question.flags`
* `BIND9` patterns (legacy as well) were adjusted to handle Bind9 >= 9.11 compatibility
* `BIND9_QUERYLOGBASE` was introduced for potential re-use

- **bro**
  * `BRO_` patterns are stricter in ECS mode - won't mistakenly match newer BRO/Zeek formats
  * place holders such as `(empty)` tags and `-` null values won't be captured
  * each `BRO_` pattern has a newer `ZEEK_` variant that supports latest Zeek 3.x versions
    e.g. `ZEEK_HTTP` as a replacement for `BRO_HTTP` (in ECS mode only),
    there's a new file **zeek** where all of the `ZEEK_XXX` pattern variants live

- **exim**
  * introduced `EXIM` (`EXIM_MESSAGE_ARRIVAL`) to match message arrival log lines - in ECS mode!

- **firewalls**
  * introduced `IPTABLES` pattern which is re-used within `SHOREWALL` and `SFW2`
  * `SHOREWALL` now supports IPv6 addresses (in ECS mode - due `IPTABLES` pattern)
  * `timestamp` fields will be captured for `SHOREWALL` and `SFW2` in legacy mode as well
  * `SHOREWALL` became less strict in containing the `kernel:` sub-string
  * `NETSCREENSESSIONLOG` properly handles optional `session_id=... reason=...` suffix
  * `interval` and `xlate_type` (legacy) CISCO fields are not captured in ECS mode

- **core** (grok-patterns)
  * `SYSLOGFACILITY` type casts facility code and priority in ECS mode
  * `SYSLOGTIMESTAMP` will be captured (from `SYSLOGBASE`) as `timestamp`
  * Fix: e-mail address's local part to match according to RFC (#273)

- **haproxy**
  * several ECS-ified fields will be type-casted to integer in ECS mode e.g. *haproxy.bytes_read*
  * fields containing null value (`-`) are no longer captured
    (e.g. in legacy mode `captured_request_cookie` gets captured even if `"-"`)

- **httpd**
  * optional fields (e.g. `http.request.referrer` or `user_agent`) are only captured when not null (`-`)
  * `source.port` (`clientport` in legacy mode) is considered optional
  * dropped raw data (`rawrequest` legacy field) in ECS mode
  * Fix: HTTPD_ERRORLOG should match when module missing (#299)

- **java**
  * `JAVASTACKTRACEPART`'s matched line number will be converted to an integer
  * `CATALINALOG` matching was updated to handle Tomcat 7/8/9 logging format
  * `TOMCATLOG` handles the default Tomcat 7/8/9 logging format
  * old (custom) legacy TOMCAT format is handled by the added `TOMCATLEGACY_LOG`
  * `TOMCATLOG` and `TOMCAT_DATESTAMP` still match the legacy format,
      however this might change at a later point - if you rely on the old format use `TOMCATLEGACY_` patterns

- **junos**
  * integer fields (e.g. `juniper.srx.elapsed_time`) are captured as integer values

- **linux-syslog**
  * `SYSLOG5424LINE` captures (overwrites) the `message` field instead of using a custom field name
  * regardless of the format used, in ECS mode, timestamps are always captured as `timestamp`
  * fields such as `log.syslog.facility.code` and `process.pid` are converted to integers

- **mcollective**
  * *mcollective-patterns* file was removed, it's all one *mcollective* in ECS mode
  * `MCOLLECTIVE`'s `process.pid` (`pid` previously) is not type-casted to an integer

- **nagios**
  * numeric fields such as `nagios.log.attempt` are converted to integer values in ECS mode

- **rails**
  * request duration times from `RAILS3` log will be converted to floating point values

- **squid**
  * `SQUID3`'s `duration` http.response `status_code` and `bytes` are type-casted to int
  * `SQUID3` pattern won't capture null ('-') `user.name` or `squid.response.content_type`
  * Fix: allow to parse SQUID log with status 0 (#298)
  * Fix: handle optional server address (#298)

* Fix: Java stack trace's JAVAFILE to better match generated names
* Fix: match Information/INFORMATION in LOGLEVEL https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/274[#274]
* Fix: NAGIOS TIMEPERIOD unknown (from/to) field matching https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/275[#275]
* Fix: HTTPD access log parse failure on missing response https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/282[#282]
* Fix: UNIXPATH to avoid DoS on long paths with unmatching chars https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/292[#292]

    For longer paths, a non matching character towards the end of the path would cause the RegExp engine a long time to abort.
    With this change we're also explicit about not supporting relative paths (using the `PATH` pattern), these won't be properly matched.

* Feat: allow UNIXPATH to match non-ascii chars https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/pull/291[#291]


[[logstash-7-11-2]]

[[logstash-7-11-1]]
=== Logstash 7.11.1 Release Notes

No user-facing changes in this release.

[[logstash-7-11-0]]
=== Logstash 7.11.0 Release Notes

==== New features and enhancements

===== Wildcard support in Central Pipeline Management

With {logstash-ref}/configuring-centralized-pipelines.html[Central Pipeline
Management], users can create {ls} pipelines in {kib}. Release 7.11.0 introduces
wildcard support, providing users a more dynamic configuration process. Users no
longer have to list all pipelines manually. Instead, Logstash will automatically
pick up new pipelines that match the wildcard set in
`xpack.management.pipeline.id`.

===== Confluent schema registry support in Kafka input plugin

In response to user requests, we have added Confluent schema registry support
and new configuration options to {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-kafka.html[Kafka
input] plugin version 10.6.0. Now you can configure the Kafka input plugin to
use the Avro deserializer to retrieve data from Kafka.

==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed

**Central Pipeline Management improvements**

This release introduces a fix to a long-standing issue for Logstash Central
Management in Kibana. When a user tried to delete a Logstash pipeline using
Kibana, the pipeline wasn’t deleted from the registry. The issue prevented users
from creating a new pipeline with the same name and config string. The issue has
been resolved in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/12387[#12387].

**Persistent Queue corruption after newly allocated page**

A Logstash crash or forceful termination could leave the queue in an
unrecoverable state, causing the following error to be logged as the pipeline
starts:

```
[ERROR][org.logstash.execution.AbstractPipelineExt] Logstash failed to create queue.
org.logstash.ackedqueue.io.MmapPageIOV2$PageIOInvalidVersionException: Expected page version=2 but found version=0
```

This has been resolved in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12554[#12554]
by ensuring the version file is persisted.

**Better handling of fatal exceptions**

Under certain circumstances, Logstash would not respect fatal errors such as
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError and would continue executing without processing data.
This issue has been addressed in
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12563[#12563]. As a consequence of this
change, Logstash will now halt immediately with exit codes associated with the kind of
fatal error:

* 128 - InternalError (error in the Java Virtual Machine)
* 127 - OutOfMemoryError
* 126 - StackOverflowError
* 125 - UnknownError (unknown error in the Java Virtual Machine)
* 124 - IOError
* 123 - LinkageError (related to JRuby/FFI)
* 120 - any other Error type not covered by a specific error code

==== Plugin releases

*Elasticsearch Input - 4.9.0*

* Added `target` option, allowing the hit's source to target a specific field instead of being expanded at the root of the event. This allows the input to play nicer with the Elastic Common Schema when the input does not follow the schema. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elasticsearch/issues/117[#117]
* [DOC] Fixed links to restructured Logstash-to-cloud docs https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elasticsearch/pull/139[#139]
* [DOC] Document the permissions required in secured clusters https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elasticsearch/pull/137[#137]

*Kafka Integration - 10.7.0*

* Switched use from Faraday to Manticore as HTTP client library to access Schema Registry service to fix issue https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/63[#63]
* Added functionality to Kafka input to use Avro deserializer in retrieving data from Kafka. The schema is retrieved from an instance of Confluent's Schema Registry service https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/51[#51]

*Validator_support Mixin - 1.0.1*

* Introduces plugin parameter validation adapters, including initial backport for `:field_reference` validator.

*Elasticsearch Output - 10.8.1*

* Fixed an issue when assigning the no-op license checker https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/984[#984]
* Refactored configuration options into specific and shared in PluginMixins namespace https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/973[#973]
* Refactored common methods into specific and shared in PluginMixins namespace https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/976[#976]


[[logstash-7-10-2]]
=== Logstash 7.10.2 Release Notes

==== Notable issues fixed

No high impact fixes in this release.

==== Plugins

*Beats Input - 6.0.12*

* Fix: log error when SSL context building fails https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/402[#402].
   We've also made sure to log messages on configuration errors as LS 7.8/7.9 only prints details when level set to debug.

*File Input - 4.2.3*

* Refactor: improve debug logging (log catched exceptions) https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/pull/280[#280]

*Elasticsearch Output - 10.7.3*

* Added composable index template support for elasticsearch version 8 https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/980[#980]
* [DOC] Fixed links to restructured Logstash-to-cloud docs https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/975[#975]
* [DOC] Document the permissions required in secured clusters https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/969[#969]

==== Other changes

* Databind upgraded to 2.9.10.6

[[logstash-7-10-1]]
=== Logstash 7.10.1 Release Notes

==== Notable issues fixed

===== Support recreation of same pipeline through centralized pipeline management
When users attempted to delete and recreate a pipeline with the same identifier and configuration, Logstash was unable
to pick up the new pipeline. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/12387[#12387]

==== Plugins

*Azure_event_hubs Input - 1.2.3*

* Fixed missing configuration of `prefetch_count` and `receive_timeout` https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-azure_event_hubs/pull/61[#61]

*Http Input - 3.3.6*

* Fixes a regression introduced in **3.1.0** with the migration to the Netty back-end that broke
browser-based workflows for some users. When a plugin that is configured to require Basic authentication receives a request that does not
include authentication, it now appropriately includes an `WWW-Authenticate` header in its `401 Unauthorized` response,
allowing the browser to collect credentials before retrying the request. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/129[#129]

*Sqs Input - 3.1.3*

* Fix: retry networking errors (with backoff) https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-sqs/pull/57[#57]

*Kafka Integration - 10.5.3*

* Fix: set (optional) truststore when endpoint id check disabled. Since **10.1.0** disabling server host-name
verification (`ssl_endpoint_identification_algorithm => ""`) did not allow the (output) plugin to set
`ssl_truststore_location => "..."` https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/60[#60]
* Docs: explain group_id in case of multiple inputs https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/59[#59]


[[logstash-7-10-0]]
=== Logstash 7.10.0 Release Notes

==== New features and enhancements

===== Architecture-specific artifacts with bundled JDK

Logstash 7.10.0 offers new architecture-specific download and installation
options that include a bundled Java Development Kit (JDK). AdoptOpenJDK 11, the
latest long term support (LTS) release, is the bundled version. Before Logstash
included the JDK, users had to install a JDK before they could install Logstash.
Logstash with AdoptOpenJDK 11 makes installation and setup easier, especially
for first time users.

**Upgrade impacts**

* If you have JAVA_HOME set to use a custom JDK, Logstash will continue to use the
JDK version you have specified.

* If you are using the system's JDK (from Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS archives, for
example) and have not set JAVA_HOME, Logstash will default to the  bundled
version of Java after you upgrade. Set JAVA_HOME to use your system's JDK if
that is the version you prefer.

===== Elastic Common Schema (ECS) compatibility

As we continue to add opt-in ECS compatibility modes in Logstash plugins,
Release 7.10.0 introduces a new pipeline-level setting in
<<logstash-settings-file,`logstash.yml`>>. The `pipeline.ecs_compatibility`
setting allows users to control the ECS compatibility of all plugins in a
pipeline at once instead of configuring each instance manually. While ECS
compatibility in these plugins is off-by-default in Logstash 7.x, we plan to
make them on-by-default in Logstash 8.0. This setting allows users to lock in a
specific behavior in advance of their next major version upgrade.

===== New Docker images and improvements

* This release adds RedHat Universal Base Images (UBIs). We have updated license
information and added fixes that enable images to pass RedHat docker image
certification. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12248[#12248],
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12296[#12296].
* We have given users more security options by exposing proxy and ssl verification
modes for management and monitoring of a Docker image.
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12201[#12201],
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12151[#12151],
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12205[#12205]


==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed

**Java pipeline execution and management**

* We have addressed an issue with the aggregate filter in the Java execution.
The issue prevented events from being generated (when the amount of time for an
aggregation event timed out), preventing a pipeline from effectively summing
events. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12204[#12204]

* We have made pipelines more stable by calling `close` on input plugins when a pipeline is
terminated or reloaded. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12195[#12195]

**Keystore thread safety.**
After a https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/10794[recent performance
improvement], Logstash could fail to start reliably in certain configurations
involving parameter expansion and multiple pipelines. Access to the shared
keystore has since been made thread-safe and is no longer a source of errors.
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12233[#12233]

**Dead letter queue (DLQ).**
We changed the DLQ writer policy to avoid the possibility of the DLQ reader processing
an incomplete DLQ segment. Logstash now writes to a temporary file that is
renamed upon completion. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12304[#12304]

**Persistent queues (PQ).**
We have addressed PQ issues in which exceptions were impacting pipeline
execution and causing Logstash to crash or to fail to reload.
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12019[#12019]

**Updates to dependencies**

* Update jruby to 9.2.13.0
* Pinned open-ssl version to 0.10.4 to avoid "Gem not found" error with
jruby-openssl-0.10.5 https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12300[#12300]

==== Plugin releases

*Elasticsearch Input - 4.8.1*

* Fixed connection error when using multiple `slices` https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elasticsearch/issues/133[#133]
* Added the ability to configure connection-, request-, and socket-timeouts with `connect_timeout_seconds`, `request_timeout_seconds`, and `socket_timeout_seconds` https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-elasticsearch/issues/121[#121]

*Kafka Integration - 10.5.1*

* [DOC]Replaced plugin_header file with plugin_header-integration file https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/46[#46]
* [DOC]Update kafka client version across kafka integration docs https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/47[#47]
* [DOC]Replace hard-coded kafka client and doc path version numbers with attributes to simplify doc maintenance https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/48[#48]
* Changed: retry sending messages only for retriable exceptions https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/29[#27]
* [DOC] Fixed formatting issues and made minor content edits https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-kafka/pull/43[#43]

*Aws Mixin - 4.4.1*

*  Fix: proxy with assumed role (properly) https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-mixin-aws/pull/50[#50]
*  Fix: credentials/proxy with assumed role.  Plugin no longer assumes
`access_key_id`/`secret_access_key` credentials not to be set when `role_arn`
specified. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-mixin-aws/pull/48[#48]

*Elasticsearch Output - 10.7.0*

* Changed: don't set the pipeline parameter if the value resolves to an empty string https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/962[#962]


[[logstash-7-9-3]]

* Fix: user rest api call + proxy configuration https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-twitter/pull/68[#68]


[[logstash-7-9-2]]
=== Logstash 7.9.2 Release Notes

==== Notable issues fixed

===== Secret store thread safety issues with multiple pipelines

Since `7.8.0`, a change to optimise the speed of loading variables from the Logstash Secret Store could cause Logstash not to be able to start when the feature was used in conjunction with multiple pipelines. This has now been fixed, and you can read the details here: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12236[#12236]

===== App Search output startup failure

Since `7.9.0`, a regression was introduced which prevented pipelines using the Elastic App Search output from starting. This release fixes support for this plugin, you can read the details here: https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elastic_app_search/pull/18[#18], https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12251[#12251]

[[jdk15-compat]]
==== Compatibility notice: {ls} and JDK 15

{ls} is not yet compatible with JDK 15.

While we are working to support JDK 15, we encourage you to use supported JDK
versions (8, 11 or 14). See <<ls-jvm>> for details and the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm[Elastic Support Matrix] for the
official word on supported versions across products and releases.

==== Plugins

*Sleep Filter - 3.0.7*

* Changed Fixnum to Integer. Fixnum was deprecated in ruby 2.4. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-sleep/pull/10[#10]

*Elastic_app_search Output - 1.1.1*

* Added missed dependency (elastic-app-search) to the gemspec https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elastic_app_search/pull/18[#18]. Fixes https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elastic_app_search/issues/17[#17]

[[logstash-7-9-1]]
=== Logstash 7.9.1 Release Notes

==== Notable issues fixed

===== Fixes in Docker image configuration of Monitoring and Central Management

As more and more users adopt our docker images, we've been getting reports on gaps where these images don't provide all the configuration knobs the other artifacts do. This release exposes more environment variables for configuring proxy support and certificate verification mode for monitoring and central management (https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12151[#12151], https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12201[#12201]), and for configuring verification_mode https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12162[#12162].

===== Pipeline execution fixes to flushing and shutdown

Since 7.2.0, a change caused terminating pipelines to not request input plugins to cleanup before shutdown, which could cause leaks in resources that weren't freed during pipeline reloads. You can find more information on the fix here: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12195[#12195]

Logstash supports ordered execution for pipelines with a single worker. A bug was found in this mode where the flushing mechanism wasn't working, preventing plugins like the aggregate filter from working correctly. This has been fixed, and you can read the details here: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12204[#12204]

===== Consistent Fingerprinting

Our fingerprint filter is a popular solution to perform deduplication of data in downstream systems like Elasticsearch, by computing a hash value based on data from each event. Users reported that this filter could produced different values for events containing the same data since it didn't ensure the order in which Hash Maps/Objects/Ruby Hashes processed their key/value pairs.
This has now been fixed, and you can read more about how it was solved and all the tests we've done here: https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-fingerprint/pull/55[#55]

===== Updated JRuby to 9.2.13.0

The new JRuby release brings greater stability to its code optimizations in multithreaded workloads and a fix to exception handling in Windows environments, both issues that could affect our users. See the https://github.com/jruby/jruby/releases/tag/9.2.13.0[JRuby release notes] for more information.

[[logstash-7-9-0]]
=== Logstash 7.9.0 Release Notes

==== New features and enhancements

===== ECS support in Elasticsearch output plugin

This release is the first step toward Elastic Common Schema (ECS) support in
{ls}. With 7.9, you can configure the <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,{es}
output plugin>> to manage index templates that are compatible with the
{ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]. The
<<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-ecs_compatibility,ECS compatibility setting>>
in the {es} output plugin makes this possible.

See
{logstash-ref}/plugins-outputs-elasticsearch.html#_compatibility_with_the_elastic_common_schema_ecs[Compatibility with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]
in the {es} output plugin docs for more information.

===== Expanded API key support

With this release, we've continued expanding support for {es} API keys. Support
for API keys in the <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch,{es} output plugin>> arrived
in {ls} 7.8.0. {ls} 7.9.0 introduces support for {es} API keys in the
<<plugins-inputs-elasticsearch,{es} input plugin>>, the
<<plugins-filters-elasticsearch,{es} filter plugin>>, and {ls}
<<ls-api-key-monitor,monitoring>> and <<ls-api-key-man,management>>.

Check out <<ls-api-keys>> for more information about using API keys with {ls}
and {es}.
Implementation details are in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11953[#11953].

===== Aarch64 (ARM64) support (experimental)

{ls} runs on arm machines! We have tested {ls} against arm64, and we are looking
to make docker and other images available soon.

ARM artifacts are not yet supported for production, and we’re offering them as
"experimental" to early adopters.

===== Improved support in App Search output

We replaced the deprecated Java client library for the
<<plugins-outputs-elastic_app_search,Elastic App Search output plugin>> with the
Ruby client library, and expanded integration testing. These changes provide a
foundation for expanding App Search integration and quality assurance in future
releases.

===== Improvements to persistent queue (PQ)

We've enhanced persistent queues to better manage exceptions and error handling
which could sometimes result in  a `LockException` when the queue file lock was
not properly released. Under some conditions, a complex pipeline that is slower
to initialize could be recreated when it was not done initializing, causing a
`LockException`. Implementation details are in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12023[#12023].

These changes result in better stability of persistent queues.

===== Improvements to pipeline workers error handling

Worker threads were not correctly monitored for a worker loop exception
resulting in a complete logstash crash upon any exception even when multiple
pipelines are running. Now only the failed pipeline is terminated. If pipeline
reloading is enabled, you can edit the config and have the failed pipeline
reloaded.
Implementation details are in
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12019[#12019] and
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12038[#12038].

===== Performance improvement on startup and pipeline restarts

This release contains several optimizations to pipeline compilation, an
essential step of the pipeline initialization process. These changes
significantly improve startup and pipeline-restart performance for complex
pipelines.
(For technical details, check out this PR: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12060[#12060].)

From our tests in three different pipelines with eight workers each, we have
seen times decrease from 9 - 28 minutes to around 1 minute.

To aid the development of pipelines, especially the performance impact of
compilation, Logstash now reports the time taken to compile each pipeline as a
log entry such as:

[source,sh]
-----
[2020-08-12T14:10:29,388][INFO ][logstash.javapipeline  ][main] Pipeline Java execution initialization time {"seconds"=>0.7}

[[logstash-7-8-1]]
=== Logstash 7.8.1 Release Notes

==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed

===== Fixed performance regression during pipeline compilation

A performance regression was introduced in 7.7.0, as described in the <<known-pipeline-slowdown,7.8.0 release notes>>.
The issue was caused by an enhancement - https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11078[#11078] - that included the plugin ids in log entries produced by Logstash pipelines.
The implementation of this feature has been fixed and no longer causes the performance issue. You can find more about the solution here https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12038[#12038].

===== Multiple fixes to pipeline shutdown and reloading

7.8.1 brings many fixes that improve the stability of the pipeline lifecycle.
In previous releases, enabling monitoring could result in Logstash crashes if pipelines from concurrent pipeline reloads (fixed in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12034[#12034]).
Also, pipelines failing to start correctly could prevent the Persistent Queue from being used afterwards (fixed in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12023[#12023]). Finally, a JRuby issue concerning threads and the Ruby/Java implementation boundary could cause crashes during pipeline reloads, and this has been fixed in https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11900[#11900].

===== Changes in the dependencies of Beats/TCP/HTTP Input Plugins

To avoid breaking changes and retain control on the set of ciphers exposed in these plugins, underlying dependencies (`tcnative` and `boringssl`) have been dropped in favor of using JVM supplied ciphers instead.
Overall there should be no impact but this may result in fewer ciphers being available if the JCE unlimited strength jurisdiction policy is not installed.
NOTE: This policy is installed by default on versions of the JDK from u161 onwards.
You can find more information in the release notes of the respective plugins.

==== Plugins

*Xml Filter - 4.1.1*

*Beats Input - 6.0.11*

* Updated jackson databind and Netty dependencies. Additionally, this release removes the dependency on `tcnative` and
      `boringssl`, using JVM supplied ciphers instead. This may result in fewer ciphers being available if the JCE
      unlimited strength jurisdiction policy is not installed. (This policy is installed by default on versions of the
      JDK from u161 onwards.) https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/393[#393]
* Added error handling to detect if ssl certificate or key files can't be read https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/394[#394]

*Http Input - 3.3.5*

* Updated jackson databind and Netty dependencies. Additionally, this release removes the dependency on `tcnative` and
   `boringssl`, using JVM supplied ciphers instead. This may result in fewer ciphers being available if the JCE
   unlimited strength jurisdiction policy is not installed. (This policy is installed by default on versions of the
   JDK from u161 onwards.) https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http/pull/126[#126]

*Syslog Input - 3.4.3*

* [DOC] Added expanded descriptions and requirements for facility_labels and severity_labels. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-syslog/pull/52[#52]

*Tcp Input - 6.0.6*

* Updated Netty dependencies. Additionally, this release removes the dependency on `tcnative` and
    `boringssl`, using JVM supplied ciphers instead. This may result in fewer ciphers being available if the JCE
    unlimited strength jurisdiction policy is not installed. (This policy is installed by default on versions of the
    JDK from u161 onwards.) https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-tcp/pull/157[#157]

*Jdbc Integration - 5.0.5*

* Fixed user sequel_opts not being passed down properly https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-jdbc/pull/37[#37]
* Refactored jdbc_streaming to share driver loading, so the fixes from the jdbc plugin also effect jdbc_streaming
* Fixed issue where JDBC Drivers that don't correctly register with Java's DriverManager fail to load (such as Sybase) https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-jdbc/pull/34[#34]
* Fixed issue where a lost connection to the database can cause errors when using prepared statements with the scheduler https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-jdbc/pull/25[#25]
* Fixed potential resource leak by ensuring scheduler is shutdown when a pipeline encounter an error during the running https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-jdbc/pull/28[#28]

*S3 Output - 4.3.2*

*  [DOC] Added note that only AWS S3 is supported. No other S3 compatible storage solutions are supported. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-s3/pull/223[#223]


[[logstash-7-8-0]]
=== Logstash 7.8.0 Release Notes

==== New features and improvements

===== Expanded JDK ecosystem and platform support

We can be more flexible and responsive in supporting new JDKs and deprecating
old ones, thanks to recent improvements to our test scripts infrastructure. This
work and other JDK14 fixes pave the way for {ls} to support both AdoptOpenJDK 11
and 14 in the near future.

{ls} has introduced support for running on CentOS/RHEL 8.x and Ubuntu 20.04.
We’ve added new JDK support for Zulu 11, AdoptOpenJDK 11, and
Oracle/OpenJDK/AdoptOpenJDK 14.


<<ls-jvm,JVM version info>> is covered in <<getting-started-with-logstash>>.
The complete list of supported operating systems and JVMs is available in the
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[support matrix].



===== {es} API key support

Support for API keys was added to {es} in 6.7.0. With 7.8.0 {ls} introduces
support for {es} API keys in the {es} output plugin
https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/934[#934].

Authentication in {es} can be done in different ways, from LDAP to SAML and
others. User/password authentication makes sense for discrete users accessing
{es}. For machine-to-machine communication, API key access is more common. Check out <<ls-api-keys>> for more information about using API keys with {ls}
and {es}.

Support for API keys in the {es} input and filter plugins, and the monitoring
and management features will be added in upcoming releases.


===== Proxy support for monitoring and centralized management

Many of our users deploy {ls} and the Elastic Stack in segmented networks where
one component may not be able to directly reach out to another or to the
Internet. {ls} plugins, such as the elasticsearch, http and SNS outputs, support
the configuration of proxy servers. Version 7.8.0 brings proxy support to
monitoring and central management
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11799[#11799].

Configure the proxy's URL in your `logstash.yml` file using
"xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.proxy" (for monitoring) or
"xpack.management.elasticsearch.proxy" (for central management).


==== Performance improvements and notable issues fixed

* Performance: Share a single secret store https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/10794[#10794]
* Performance: Improve event.clone memory usage https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11794[#11794]
* Refactor: Avoid array in case of single event https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11732[#11732]
* Debugging: Print RUBY_DESCRIPTION at startup to facilitate debugging https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11852[#11852]
* Fix: Avoid gsub (frame dependent) usage from Java https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11874[#11874]

==== Announcement: Azure and Netflow module deprecation

Azure and Netflow modules in Logstash have been deprecated and replaced by
the Azure modules in {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-azure.html[{filebeat}] and
{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-module-azure.html[{metricbeat}], and the Netflow
module in {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-netflow.html[{filebeat}]. The
{filebeat} and {metricbeat} modules are compliant with the
{ecs-ref}/index.html[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].

[[known-pipeline-slowdown]]
==== Known issue

*Performance regression.* A potential performance regression may affect
some users. This issue can cause a slowdown on pipeline compilation when
multiple large pipelines are in use. We believe the issue was introduced in 7.7.0.
This issue is currently being tracked and investigated in
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/12031[#12031]

This issue seems to be affecting only big pipeline installations (that is, big
pipeline definitions when multiple pipelines are defined). Symptoms include
increased startup time and the appearance that Logstash is not responding to
input events.

If you believe this issue is affecting you, we recommended that you downgrade to
7.6.2 while we continue to investigate and provide a resolution.

==== Plugins

*Cef Codec - 6.1.1*

* Improved encoding performance, especially when encoding many extension fields https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/pull/81[#81]
* Fixed CEF short to long name translation for ahost/agentHostName field, according to documentation https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/pull/75[#75]

https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11747[#11747]

* Fixed: when the Keystore is enabled, pipelines with many variable substitutions now load significantly faster
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11772[#11772]

* Fixed: when x-pack Monitoring is configured with `cloud_id`, the monitoring pipeline now correctly resolves the hosts.
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11800[#11800]

==== Known issue

*Performance regression.* A potential performance regression may affects
some users. This issue can cause a slowdown on pipeline compilation when
multiple pipelines are in use. We believe the issue was introduced in 7.7.0.
This issue is currently being tracked and investigated in
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/12031[#12031]

This issue seems to be affecting only big pipeline installations (that is, big
pipeline definitions when multiple pipelines are defined). Symptoms include
increased startup time and the appearance that Logstash is not responding to
input events.

If you believe this issue is affecting you, we recommended that you downgrade to
7.6.2 while we continue to investigate and provide a resolution.

==== Plugins

*Elasticsearch Output - 10.4.2*

* Internal: changed cloud id, credential and host setup to happen in `build_client`, enabling Logstash's x-pack monitoring to use these features without caring about this plugin's internals https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/939[#939]

* [DOC] Added note about `_type` setting change from `doc` to `_doc` https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/884[#884]

* Fixed default index value to use calendar year instead of the year corresponding to the ISO week year https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/927[#927]


[[logstash-7-7-0]]
=== Logstash 7.7.0 Release Notes

==== New features and improvements

===== Improving Logging

Continuing with the Logging improvements made in the past couple of releases,
log messages have been expanded to more accurately display information about
plugins. These changes allow users to better identify log messages with plugins
or pipelines.
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11078[#11078],
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11593[#11593],
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11567[#11567]

Changes include:

* Added `plugin.name` to all log entries.
* Added `plugin.id` and `pipeline.id` to docker images.

===== Improving the Java (Pipeline) Execution Engine

The improvements available in {ls} 7.7 give users more control over event
ordering for single worker pipelines.

Historically, Logstash event ordering between an input plugin and output plugin
were preserved when a single worker executed a pipeline. This behaviour was
never officially documented, but it was a feature that many users relied upon.

When the Java Execution engine was introduced, it broke the single worker
ordering preservation. This has now been fixed with the introduction of the
`pipeline.ordered` setting.
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11552[#11552],
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11710[#11710]

The `pipeline.ordered` setting allows three modes:

* `auto (default)` - to automatically enable ordering if there’s only one pipeline
worker.
* `true` - enforces ordering while preventing logstash from starting if there are
multiple workers.
* `false` - ordering will not be guaranteed.

==== Notable issues fixed

* Fixed: Add `sudo` into the rpm import of GPG-KEY
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11684[#11684]

* Fixed: Use lightweight regex matching (which does not depend on frames)
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11653[#11653]

* Fixed: Issue where monitoring API does not properly resolve ids including
environment variable expansion
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11592[#11592]

* Fixed: Change Javadoc to conform to updated requirements for JDK13
https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/11642[#11642]

[[logstash-7-2-0]]
=== Logstash 7.2.0 Release Notes

* Native support for Java Plugins (GA) https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/10620[#10620]. Changes to Java plugins for GA include:

   ** BREAKING: The signature for the codec.encode() method was changed to make the codec API easier to use correctly in pipelines with multiple concurrent workers.
   ** BREAKING: The return type on the Context::getDlqWriter method was changed to an interface to decouple it from any specific DLQ implementation.
   ** BETA: Isolated classloader for Java plugins. When enabled with the pipeline.plugin_classloaders flag, each Java plugin will be loaded with its own parent-last classloader. All dependencies for the Java plugin, with the exception of any classes in org.logstash.* or co.elastic.logstash.* packages, will be loaded first from the plugin's jar file delegating to the main Logstash classloader only if the dependency is not found within the plugin's jar. This allows Java plugins to use dependencies that might clash with the dependencies for other Java plugins or Logstash core itself.
   ** Gradle tasks to automate the packaging of Java plugins as Ruby gems. The gem task will bootstrap all JRuby dependencies, automatically generate Gemfile and the gemspec file for the plugin as well as the two "glue" Ruby source files for triggering the loading of the Java class files during Logstash startup, and then invoke the necessary commands to create the gem file itself. The gem task also performs a number of validation checks to proactively identify common problems with the packaging of Java plugins. The clean task will remove all of those generated artifacts.
   ** Java plugin validation. At pipeline startup, all Java plugins will be checked to ensure that they implement the same version of the Java plugin API present in the current Logstash version.
   ** DLQ writer interface provided to Java plugins.
   ** Float, URI, and password config types, each of which provide validation for the supplied config value.
   ** New built-in Java plugins:
   *** A Java-based generator input for testing with the same capabilities as the Ruby generator input as well as an optional eps option to generate events at a given event-per-second rate for situations where as-fast-as-possible event generation is too much.
   *** Also includes a jdots codec that mirrors the Ruby dots codec.
   *** Java-based sink output that discards any events received. Analogous to the Ruby null plugin though much faster.
