[[logstash-8-5-1]]
=== Logstash 8.5.1 Release Notes

[[notable-8.5.1]]
==== Notable issues fixed

* Fixes the reporting of configuration errors when using multiple-pipelines to make them more actionable https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14713[#14713]

[[dependencies-8.5.1]]
==== Updates to dependencies

* The bundled JDK has been updated to 17.0.5+8 https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14728[#14728]

[[plugins-8-5-1]]
==== Plugins

*Cef Codec - 6.2.6*

* Fix: when decoding, escaped newlines and carriage returns in extension values are now correctly decoded into literal newlines and carriage returns respectively https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/pull/98[#98]
* Fix: when decoding, non-CEF payloads are identified and intercepted to prevent data-loss and corruption. They now cause a descriptive log message to be emitted, and are emitted as their own `_cefparsefailure`-tagged event containing the original bytes in its `message` field https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/issues/99[#99]
* Fix: when decoding while configured with a `delimiter`, flushing this codec now correctly consumes the remainder of its internal buffer. This resolves an issue where bytes that are written without a trailing delimiter could be lost https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-cef/issues/100[#100]

*Json Codec - 3.1.1*

* Fix: when decoded JSON includes an `[event][original]` field, having `ecs_compatibility` enabled will no longer overwrite the decoded field https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-json/pull/43[#43]

*Grok Filter - 4.4.3*

* Minor typos in docs examples https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-grok/pull/176[#176]

*Tcp Input - 6.3.1*

* Fixes a regression in which the ssl_subject was missing for SSL-secured connections in server mode https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-tcp/pull/199[#199]

*Unix Input - 3.1.2*

* Fix: eliminate high CPU usage when data timeout is disabled and no data is available on the socket https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-unix/pull/30[#30]

*Rabbitmq Integration - 7.3.1*

* DOCS: clarify the availability and cost of using the `metadata_enabled` option https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-integration-rabbitmq/pull/52[#52]

*Elasticsearch Output - 11.9.3*

* DOC: clarify that `http_compression` option only affects _requests_; compressed _responses_ have always been read independent of this setting https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/1030[#1030]

* Fix broken link to Logstash Reference https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/1085[#1085]

* Fixes a possible infinite-retry-loop that could occur when this plugin is configured with an `action` whose value contains a <<sprintf,sprintf-style placeholder>> that fails to be resolved for an individual event.
Events in this state are routed to the pipeline's <<dead-letter-queues,dead letter queue (DLQ)>> if the DLQ is enabled.
Otherwise, these events are logged-and-dropped so that the remaining events in the batch can be processed. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/pull/1080[#1080]

[[logstash-8-5-0]]

[[logstash-8-4-0]]
=== Logstash 8.4.0 Release Notes


[[features-8.4.0]]
==== New features and enhancements

[[dlq-8.4.0]]
===== Improvements to the dead letter queue (DLQ)

This release brings significant improvements to help users manage their dead letter queues, including:

* A new `clean_consumed` option on the Dead Letter Queue input plugin.
It can automatically delete segments from a dead letter queue after all events in the segment have been consumed by a Logstash pipeline.
* A new age retention policy, enabling the automatic removal of segments from a dead letter queue
based on the age of events within those segments.
* Additional dead letter queue metrics available from the monitoring API https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14324[#14324]

[[aws-8.4.0]]
===== New AWS integration plugin

Several AWS plugins are now bundled in a single {logstash-ref}/plugins-integrations-aws.html[AWS integration plugin], enabling easier maintenance and upgrades of AWS-based
plugins. They all use version 3 of the AWS Ruby SDK.

[[jdk-8.4.0]]
===== JDK17 support

Logstash now comes bundled with JDK17, while still providing compatibility with user-supplied JDK11.
The new JDK includes an update pertaining to a potential security vulnerability.

[[logstash-8-3-3]]
=== Logstash 8.3.3 Release Notes

[[notable-8.3.3]]
==== Notable issue fixed
* We fixed an issue which occurred when users ran the plugin manager or the keystore with the bundled JVM.
  Some mandatory JVM options were not being picked up from the JvmOptionsParser,
  breaking compatibility with Windows on certain versions of the JDK. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14355[#14355]

[[plugins-8.3.3]]

[[logstash-8-3-2]]
=== Logstash 8.3.2 Release Notes

No user-facing changes in this release.

[[logstash-8-3-1]]
=== Logstash 8.3.1 Release Notes

[[notable-8.3.1]]
==== Notable issues fixed

* We fixed an event serializing incompatibility introduced in 8.3.0 https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14314[#14314]
  If you're using dead letter queues or persistent queues we recommend that you do not use Logstash 8.3.0 and upgrade to 8.3.1.

[[logstash-8-3-0]]
=== Logstash 8.3.0 Release Notes

[[known-issue-8-3-0]]
==== Known issue

An event serialization bug was discovered, which causes an issue when trying to read dead letter or persistent queues created
in previous versions of Logstash.

We recommend not upgrading to Logstash 8.3.0 if you are using dead letter or persistent queues.

[[features-8.3.0]]
==== New features and enhancements

* {ls} is more efficient at fetching pipelines as of 8.3.0.
When a {ls} instance sends its pipeline IDs to {es} or central pipeline management in {kib}, it gets back only the pipeline configs that belong to that instance.
These enhancements required changes to both {ls} https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14076[(#14076)] and {es} https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/85847[(#85847)].
+
These improvements dramatically decrease network load while also giving users the ability to control pipelines dynamically using wildcards.

* Dead Letter Queues can now be configured to drop older events instead of new ones when they're full. The setting "dead_letter_queue.storage_policy" has been introduced for this purpose, and new metrics - such as a counter for dropped events - are now exposed in the API to better monitor the DLQ behavior. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13923[#13923] https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14058[#14058]

* To improve security of Logstash deployments, 8.3.0 brings a new setting "allow_superuser" that defaults to false. When enabled it prevents Logstash from starting as super user ("root"). This setting will be enabled by default in the future. Consider explicitly enabling it. Otherwise a deprecation log entry will be emitted. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14046[#14046] https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14089[#14089]

* Continuing with the focus on security, we've introduced "api.auth.basic.password_policy.mode" to ensure the password used to guard Logstash's HTTP API has a minimum set of strength requirements. By default a warning will be emitted if the defined password doesn't meet the criteria, but in a future release the mode will be set to "ERROR". https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14045[#14045] https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14105[#14105] https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14159[#14159]

* Elasticsearch introduced "security on by default" back in 8.0.0, with TLS enabled by default in its HTTP and transport layers. To facilitate connecting to 8.x clusters, Elasticsearch displays the fingerprint of the Certificate Authority it generates on startup. This release of Logstash introduces support for setting "ca_trusted_fingerprint" in Elasticsearch input, filter and outputs plugins. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14120[#14120]

* Technical Preview: Receiving events containing keys with characters that have special meaning to Logstash such as `[` and `]` (for field references) has always causes issues to data ingestion. A new setting in Technical Preview, disabled by default, called "config.field_reference.escape_style" was introduced to handle such special characters by escaping them. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14044[#14044]

[[notable-8.3.0]]
==== Notable issues fixed

* Don't display values of password type settings in conditionals https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13997[#13997]
* Introduce a retry mechanism in pipeline-to-pipeline instead of crashing https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14027[#14027]
* Add thread safety around Puma startup/shutdown https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14080[#14080]
* Add value converters for java.time classes https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13972[#13972]
* Correct the class reference to the MetricNotFound exception https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13970[#13970]
* Fix a possible corruption of Persistent Queue during a crash of the Logstash process https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/14165[#14165]

[[logstash-8-1-0]]
=== Logstash 8.1.0 Release Notes

[[known-issue-8-1-0]]
==== Known issue

Uninstalling a plugin using `bin/logtash-plugin uninstall` may
result in an error:

```
Gem::LoadError: You have already activated jruby-openssl 0.12.2, but your Gemfile requires jruby-openssl 0.12.1. Prepending `bundle exec` to your command may solve this.
```

Logstash should still run, and other plugin operations, such as `update` and `install`, should work as expected.

NOTE: The `bin/logstash-plugin list` command may fail with the same error after a failed uninstallation.

**Resolution**

A successful plugin `update` will resolve this issue, and allow subsequent `uninstall` and `list` operations to
work without issue.

The `filter-dissect` plugin has recent changes available for update. 
Running `bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-filter-dissect` should mitigate this issue.

[[logstash-8-0-0]]
=== Logstash 8.0.0 Release Notes

The following list are changes in 8.0.0 as compared to 7.17.0, and combines release notes from the 8.0.0-alpha1, -alpha2, -beta1, -rc1 and -rc2 releases.

[[breaking-8.0.0]]
==== Breaking changes
* Many plugins can now be run in a mode that avoids implicit conflict with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS).
  This mode is controlled individually with each plugin’s ecs_compatibility option, which defaults to the value of the Logstash pipeline.ecs_compatibility setting.
  In Logstash 8, this compatibility mode will be on-by-default for all pipelines.
  If you wish to lock in a pipeline’s behavior from Logstash 7.x before upgrading to Logstash 8,
  you can set `pipeline.ecs_compatibility: disabled` to its definition in `pipelines.yml` (or globally in `logstash.yml`).
* Starting from Logstash 8.0, the minimum required version of Java to run Logstash is Java 11.
  By default, Logstash will run with the bundled JDK, which has been verified to work with each specific version of Logstash,
  and generally provides the best performance and reliability.
* Support for using `JAVA_HOME` to override the path to the JDK that Logstash runs with has been removed for this release.
  In the `8.x` release, users should set the value of `LS_JAVA_HOME` to the path of their preferred JDK if they
  wish to use a version other than the bundled JDK. The value of `JAVA_HOME` will be ignored.
* The Java Execution Engine has been the default engine since Logstash 7.0, and works with plugins written in either Ruby or Java.
  Removal of the Ruby Execution Engine will not affect the ability to run existing pipelines. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12517[#12517]
* We have added support for UTF-16 and other multi-byte-character when reading log files. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9702[#9702]
* Setting `config.field_reference.parser` has been removed.
  The Field Reference parser interprets references to fields in your pipelines and plugins.
  Its behavior was configurable in 6.x, and since 7.0 allowed only a single option: `strict`.
  8.0 no longer recognizes the setting, but maintains the same behavior as the `strict` setting.
  {ls} rejects ambiguous and illegal inputs as standard behavior. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12466[#12466]

For a more detailed view of these changes please check <<breaking-8.0>>.

[[features-8.0.0]]
==== New features and enhancements
* As processing times speed up, millisecond granularity is not always enough. Inbound data increasingly has sub-millisecond granularity timestamps.
  The pull request https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12797[#12797] allows the internal mechanisms of
  Logstash that hold moment-in-time data - such as the Logstash Event, the Persistent Queue, the Dead Letter Queue and JSON encoding/decoding - to have nanosecond granularity.
* We have added another flag to the Benchmark CLI to allow passing a data file with previously captured data to the custom test case.
  This feature allows users to run the Benchmark CLI in a custom test case with a custom config and a custom dataset. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12437[#12437]

==== Plugins

Logstash 8.0.0 includes the same versions of all bundled plugins as Logstash 7.17.0.

[[logstash-8-0-0-rc2]]
=== Logstash 8.0.0-rc2 Release Notes

[[notable-8.0.0-rc2]]
==== Notable issues fixed
* Fixed long-standing issue in which the `events.out` count incorrectly included events that had been dropped with the drop filter.
Now the total out event count includes only events that reach the out stage. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13593[#13593]
* Reduced scope and impact of a memory leak that can be caused by using UUIDs or other high-cardinality field names https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13642[#13642]
* Fixed an issue with the Azure input plugin that caused Logstash to crash when the input was used in a pipeline. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/13603[#13603]

==== Plugin releases
Plugins align with release 7.17.0


[[logstash-8-0-0-rc1]]
=== Logstash 8.0.0-rc1 Release Notes

==== Breaking changes

[[rn-ecs-compatibility]]
===== ECS compatibility
Many plugins can now be run in a mode that avoids implicit conflict with the Elastic Common Schema (ECS). This mode is controlled individually with each plugin’s ecs_compatibility option, which defaults to the value of the Logstash pipeline.ecs_compatibility setting. In Logstash 8, this compatibility mode will be on-by-default for all pipelines.

If you wish to lock in a pipeline’s behavior from Logstash 7.x before upgrading to Logstash 8, you can set pipeline.ecs_compatibility: disabled to its definition in pipelines.yml (or globally in logstash.yml).

==== New features and enhancements

Logstash Docker images are now based on Ubuntu 20.04.

Plugins align with release 7.16.2


[[logstash-8-0-0-beta1]]
=== Logstash 8.0.0-beta1 Release Notes

==== Breaking changes

[[rn-java-11-minimum]]
===== Java 11 minimum
Starting from Logstash 8.0, the minimum required version of Java to run Logstash is Java 11. By default, Logstash will
run with the bundled JDK, which has been verified to work with each specific version of Logstash, and generally
provides the best performance and reliability.

See <<breaking-changes>> for a preview of additional breaking changes coming your way. 

==== New features and enhancements

[[rn-nanosecond-precision]]
===== Nanosecond precision
As processing times speed up, millisecond granularity is not always enough. Inbound data increasingly has sub-millisecond granularity timestamps.
The pull request https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12797[#12797] allows the internal mechanisms of Logstash that hold moment-in-time data - such as the Logstash Event, the Persistent Queue, the Dead Letter Queue and JSON encoding/decoding - to have nanosecond granularity.

Timestamp precision is limited to the JVM and Platform's available granularity, which in many cases is microseconds.

This change also grants users access to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#patterns[Java time's improved formatters], which include support fort ISO quarters, week-of-month, and a variety of timezone/offset-related format substitutions. For example:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filter {
  mutate {
    add_field => {"nanos" => "Nanos: %{{n}}" }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Results in the following event:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
    "@timestamp" => 2021-10-31T22:32:34.747968Z,
          "host" => "logstash.lan",
         "nanos" => "Nanos: 747968000",
       "message" => "test",
          "type" => "stdin",
      "@version" => "1"
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[logstash-8-0-0-alpha2]]
=== Logstash 8.0.0-alpha2 Release Notes

==== Breaking changes

[[java-home-breaking-change]]
===== Removed support for JAVA_HOME
Support for using `JAVA_HOME` to override the path to the JDK that Logstash runs with has been removed for this release.
In the `8.x` release, users should set the value of `LS_JAVA_HOME` to the path of their preferred JDK if they
wish to use a version other than the bundled JDK. The value of `JAVA_HOME` will be ignored.

==== Plugin releases
Plugins align with release 7.15.0

[[logstash-8-0-0-alpha1]]
=== Logstash 8.0.0-alpha1 Release Notes

==== Breaking changes

[[ruby-engine]]
===== Ruby Execution Engine removed
The Java Execution Engine has been the default engine since Logstash 7.0, and works with plugins written in either Ruby or Java.
Removal of the Ruby Execution Engine will not affect the ability to run existing pipelines. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12517[#12517]

[[utf-16]]
===== Support for UTF-16
We have added support for UTF-16 and other multi-byte-character when reading log files. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9702[#9702]

[[field-ref-parser]]
===== Field Reference parser removed
The Field Reference parser interprets references to fields in your pipelines and
plugins. It was configurable in 7.x, with the default set to strict to reject
inputs that are ambiguous or illegal. Configurability is removed in 8.0. Now
{ls} rejects ambiguous and illegal inputs as standard behavior. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12466[#12466]

==== New features and enhancements

**Option to pass custom data to the benchmark CLI**

We have added another flag to the Benchmark CLI to allow passing a data file with previously captured data to the custom test case.
This feature allows users to run the Benchmark CLI in a custom test case with a custom config and a custom dataset. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12437[#12437]

==== Plugin releases
Plugins align with release 7.14.0
