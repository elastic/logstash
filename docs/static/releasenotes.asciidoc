[[logstash-6-4-0]]
=== Logstash 6.4.0 Release Notes

[IMPORTANT]
--
**Attention users of Kafka Output in Logstash 6.4.0**

If you are using Kafka output and have upgraded to Logstash 6.4.0, you will see pipeline startup errors:

    Pipeline aborted due to error {:pipeline_id=>"pipeline1", :exception=>org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigException: Invalid value 32768 for configuration receive.buffer.bytes: Expected value to be a 32-bit integer, but it was a java.lang.Long

This error was due to an incorrectly configured default value for the
`receive_buffer_bytes` option (fixed in PR
https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-kafka/pull/205[logstash-output-kafka #205]),
and false negative results on our CI due to incorrect exit code
handling (fixed in
https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-kafka/pull/204[logstash-output-kafka#204]).

Kafka output plugin version 7.1.3 has been released. You can upgrade
using:

[source,sh]
-----
bin/logstash-plugin update logstash-output-kafka
-----

This version will be included in the next 6.4.1 patch release.

*Fingerprint Filter*

* Adds support for non-keyed, regular hash functions. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-fingerprint/issues/18[#18]

*KV Filter*

* Adds `whitespace => strict` mode, which allows the parser to behave more predictably when input is known to avoid unnecessary whitespace. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-kv/pull/67[#67]
* Adds error handling, which tags the event with `_kv_filter_error` if an exception is raised while handling an event instead of allowing the plugin to crash. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-kv/pull/68[#68]

*Azure Event Hubs Input*

* Initial version of the {logstash-ref}/plugins-inputs-azure_event_hubs.html[azure_event_hubs input plugin], which supersedes logstash-input-azureeventhub.

*Beats Input*

* Adds `add_hostname` flag to enable/disable the population of the `host` field from the beats.hostname. field https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/340[#340]
* Fixes handling of batches where the sequence numbers do not start with 1. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/342[#342]

* Fixes `ssl_verify_mode => peer`. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-beats/pull/326[#326]

*Exec Input*

* Fixes issue where certain log entries were incorrectly writing 'jdbc input' instead of 'exec input'. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-exec/pull/21[#21]

*File Input*

* Adds new feature: `mode` setting. Introduces two modes, `tail` mode is the existing behaviour for tailing, `read` mode is new behaviour that is optimized for the read complete content scenario. Please read the docs to fully appreciate the benefits of `read` mode.
* Adds new feature: File completion actions. Settings `file_completed_action` and `file_completed_log_path` control what actions to do after a file is completely read. Applicable: `read` mode only.
* Adds new feature: in `read` mode, compressed files can be processed, GZIP only.
* Adds new feature: Files are sorted after being discovered. Settings `file_sort_by` and `file_sort_direction` control the sort order. Applicable: any mode.
* Adds new feature: Banded or striped file processing. Settings: `file_chunk_size` and `file_chunk_count` control banded or striped processing. Applicable: any mode.
* Adds new feature: `sincedb_clean_after` setting. Introduces expiry of sincedb records. The default is 14 days. If, after `sincedb_clean_after` days, no activity has been detected on a file (inode) the record expires and is not written to disk. The persisted record now includes the "last activity seen" timestamp. Applicable: any mode.
* Moves Filewatch code into the plugin folder, rework Filewatch code to use Logstash facilities like logging and environment.
* Adds much better support for file rotation schemes of copy/truncate and rename cascading. Applies to tail mode only.
* Adds support for processing files over remote mounts e.g. NFS. Before, it was possible to read into memory allocated but not filled with data resulting in ASCII NUL (0) bytes in the message field. Now, files are read up to the size as given by the remote filesystem client. Applies to tail and read modes.
* Fixes `read` mode of regular files sincedb write is requested in each read loop iteration rather than waiting for the end-of-file to be reached. Note: for gz files, the sincedb entry can only be updated at the end of the file as it is not possible to seek into a compressed file and begin reading from that position. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/pull/196[#196]
* Adds support for String Durations in some settings e.g. `stat_interval => "750 ms"`. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/pull/194[#194]
* Fixes `require winhelper` error in WINDOWS. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/184[#184]
* Fixes issue, where when no delimiter is found in a chunk, the chunk is reread - no forward progress is made in the file. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/185[#185]
* Fixes JAR_VERSION read problem, prevented Logstash from starting. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/180[#180]
* Fixes sincedb write error when using /dev/null, repeatedly causes a plugin restart. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/182[#182]
* Fixes a regression where files discovered after first discovery were not always read from the beginning. Applies to tail mode only. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-file/issues/198[#198]

[float]
==== Plugins

*Netflow Codec*

* Fixes exception when receiving Netflow 9 from H3C devices.

* Fixes an issue where trace-level logging omitted helpful context.

*Kafka Input*

* Fix race-condition where shutting down a Kafka Input before it completes startup could cause Logstash to crash.
* Upgrade Kafka client to version 1.1.0.

*S3 Input*

* Avoid plugin crashes when encountering 'bad' files in S3 buckets.
* Log entry when bucket is empty.
* Fixes `additional_settings` configuration option to properly symbolize keys for downstream library.

*TCP Input*

* New configuration option to set TCP keep-alive.
* Fixes an issue where the input could crash during shutdown, affecting pipeline reloads.

*UDP Input*

* Mitigate memory leak in JRuby's UDP implementation.

*DNS Filter*

* Log timeouts as warn instead of error.
* Allow concurrent queries when cache enabled.

*Elasticsearch Filter*

* Fix: The filter now only calls filter_matched on events that actually matched. This fixes issues where all events would have success-related actions happened when no match had actually happened (`add_tag`, `add_field`, `remove_tag`, `remove_field`).

*JDBC Static Filter*

* Fixed an issue where failing to specify `index_columns` would result in an obscure error message.

*KV Filter*

* improves `trim_key` and `trim_value` to trim any _sequence_ of matching characters from the beginning and ends of the corresponding keys and values; a previous implementation limited trim to a single character from each end, which was surprising.
* fixes issue where we can fail to correctly break up a sequence that includes a partially-quoted value followed by another fully-quoted value by slightly reducing greediness of quoted-value captures.

*Mutate Filter*

* Fix: when converting to `float` and `float_eu`, explicitly support same range of inputs as their integer counterparts.

* Added support for customizing HTTP headers.
* Log an error -- not a warning -- when ES raises an invalid_index_name_exception.
* Improve plugin behavior when Elasticsearch is down on startup.

* Upgrade Kafka client to version 1.1.0.

*S3 Output*

* Fixes `additional_settings` configuration option to properly symbolize keys for downstream library.

*SQS Output*

[[logstash-6-2-4]]
=== Logstash 6.2.4 Release Notes

* Fixed an issue where events passing through the persistent queue had the contents of string type fields corrupted for values containing non-ASCII characters. The solution involved serializing the RubyString as Java String UTF-16 encoded https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9167[#9167]

  Events for a given `task_id` will be aggregated for as long as they keep arriving within the defined `inactivity_timeout` option - the inactivity timeout is reset each time a new event happens. On the contrary, `timeout` is never reset and happens after `timeout` seconds since aggregation map creation.
