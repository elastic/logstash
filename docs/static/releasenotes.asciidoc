==== Plugins
*Netflow Codec*

*JDBC_static Filter*

* Support multiple driver libraries https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-jdbc_static/issues/22[#22]
* Use Java classloader to load driver jar. Use system import from file to loader local database. Prevent locking errors when no records returned. https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-jdbc_static/issues/18[#18], https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-jdbc_static/issues/17[#17], https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-jdbc_static/issues/12[#12]

[[logstash-6-2-4]]
=== Logstash 6.2.4 Release Notes

* Fixed an issue where events passing through the persistent queue had the contents of string type fields corrupted for values containing non-ASCII characters. The solution involved serializing the RubyString as Java String UTF-16 encoded https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9167[#9167]
* Fixed serialization bug when a RubyString that comes out of a matching, substring or similar operation may not have offset 0 pointing at the underlying BytesList. Solved by serializing the correct part of the BytesList https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9308[#9308]
* Improved performance of Event#cancel, where each operation would unnecessarily generate a new object. In configurations that use plugins like the `drop filter` throughput may increase up to 5x https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9284[#9284]
* Fixed an issue with type handling in metadata fields. Before this a plugin could trigger a Java exception when placing data into an event's metadata https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9299[#9299]
* Fixed a race condition in shutdown of pipelines where not all workers would consume a single SHUTDOWN signal https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9285[#9285]
* Multiple documentation improvements relating to configuration files, JVM options, default plugin codecs, Logstash-to-Logstash communication and Keystore.

==== Plugins

*Json_lines Codec*

* Support flush method, see https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-json_lines/pull/35

*Netflow Codec*

* Workaround for breaking change in Netflow-Input-UDP > 3.2.0, see issue https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-netflow/issues/122[#122]
* Renamed some unknown VMware VDS fields

*Aggregate Filter*

* new feature: add 'timeout_timestamp_field' option.
  When set, this option computes timeout based on event timestamp field (and not system time). It's particularly useful when processing old logs.
* new feature: add 'inactivity_timeout' option.
  Events for a given `task_id` will be aggregated for as long as they keep arriving within the defined `inactivity_timeout` option - the inactivity timeout is reset each time a new event happens. On the contrary, `timeout` is never reset and happens after `timeout` seconds since aggregation map creation.

*Dns Filter*

* Logging improvement to include DNS resolution failure reason https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-dns/issues/36[#36]
* Fix bug where forward lookups would not cache timeout errors
