[[logstash-8-0-0-alpha1]]
=== Logstash 8.0.0-alpha1 Release Notes

==== Breaking changes

[[ruby-engine]]
===== Ruby Execution Engine removed
The Java Execution Engine has been the default engine since Logstash 7.0, and works with plugins written in either Ruby or Java.
Removal of the Ruby Execution Engine will not affect the ability to run existing pipelines. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12517[#12517]

[[utf-16]]
===== Support for UTF-16
We have added support for UTF-16 and other multi-byte-character when reading log files. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/9702[#9702]

[[field-ref-parser]]
===== Field Reference parser removed
The Field Reference parser interprets references to fields in your pipelines and
plugins. It was configurable in 7.x, with the default set to strict to reject
inputs that are ambiguous or illegal. Configurability is removed in 8.0. Now
{ls} rejects ambiguous and illegal inputs as standard behavior. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12466[#12466]

==== New features and enhancements

**Option to pass custom data to the benchmark CLI**

We have added another flag to the Benckmark CLI to allow passing a data file with previously captured data to the custom test case.
This feature allows users to run the Benchmark CLI in a custom test case with a custom config and a custom dataset. https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/12437[#12437]

==== Plugin releases
Plugins align with release 7.14.0
