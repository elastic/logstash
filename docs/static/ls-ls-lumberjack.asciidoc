==== Lumberjack output to Beats input

Logstash-to-Logstash using Lumberjack and Beats has been our standard approach for {ls}-to-{ls}, and may still be the best option for more robust use cases. 

Before you implement the Lumberjack to Beats configuration, keep these points in mind: 

* Lumberjack and Beats provides high availability, but does not provide load balancing. 
The Lumberjack output plugin allows defining multiple output hosts for high availability, but instead of load-balancing between all output hosts, it falls back to one host on the list in the case of failure.
* If you need a proxy between the Logstash instances, TCP proxy is the only option.
* There's no explicit way to exert back pressure back to the beats input.
