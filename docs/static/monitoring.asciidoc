== Monitoring Logstash

When you run Logstash, it automatically captures runtime metrics that you can
use to monitor the health and performance of your Logstash deployment.

The metrics collected by Logstash include:

* Logstash node info, like pipeline settings, OS info, and JVM info.
* Plugin info, including a list of installed plugins.
* Node stats, like JVM stats, process stats, event-related stats, and pipeline
runtime stats.
* Hot threads.

You can use the <<logstash-monitoring-ui,monitoring UI>> in X-Pack to view
these metrics and gain insight into how your Logstash deployment is running.

Or you can use the basic <<monitoring,monitoring APIs>> providing by Logstash
to retrieve these metrics.

NOTE: Monitoring is an X-Pack feature under the Basic License and is therefore
*free to use*. To get started, consult the
{xpack-ref}monitoring-logstash.html[Logstash monitoring documentation].

When running Logstash 5.2 or greater, you can use the
https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/monitoring[monitoring feature in X-Pack]
to gain deep visibility into metrics about your Logstash deployment. In the
overview dashboard, you can see all events received and sent by Logstash, plus
info about memory usage and uptime:

Then you can drill down to see stats about a specific node:

See the {xpack-ref}/monitoring-logstash.html[Logstash monitoring documentation] to learn
how to set up and use this feature.
