# List your plugin [plugin-listing]

The [Logstash Reference](/reference/index.md) is the first place {{ls}} users look for plugins and documentation. If your plugin meets the [quality and acceptance guidelines](/extend/index.md#plugin-acceptance), we may be able to list it in the guide.

The plugin source and documentation will continue to live in your repo, and we will direct users there.

If you would like to have your plugin included in the [Logstash Reference](/reference/index.md), create a new [issue](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash/issues) in the Logstash repository with the following information:

* Title: `PluginListing: <your-plugin-name>`
* Body:

    * Brief description of the plugin (what it is and what it does).
    * Link to the plugin repository.
    * Link to the README.md or docs/index.asciidoc.
    * Describe how your plugin meets our [quality and acceptance guidelines](/extend/index.md#plugin-acceptance).

* Labels: `docs`, `new-plugin`
