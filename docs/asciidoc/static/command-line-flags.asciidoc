=== Command-line flags

Logstash has the following flags. You can use the `--help` flag to display this information.

[source,shell]
----------------------------------
-f, --config CONFIGFILE
 Load the Logstash config from a specific file, directory, or a wildcard. If
 given a directory or wildcard, config files will be read from the directory in
 alphabetical order.

-e CONFIGSTRING
 Use the given string as the configuration data. Same syntax as the config file.
 If not input is specified, 'stdin { type => stdin }' is default. If no output
 is specified, 'stdout { codec => rubydebug }}' is default.

-w, --filterworkers COUNT
 Sets the number of filter workers to run (default: 1)

-l, --log FILE
 Log to a given path. Default is to log to stdout

--verbose
 Increase verbosity to the first level (info), less verbose.

--debug
 Increase verbosity to the last level (trace), more verbose.

-V, --version
  Display the version of Logstash.

-p, --pluginpath
  A path of where to find plugins. This flag can be given multiple times to include
  multiple paths. Plugins are expected to be in a specific directory hierarchy:
  'PATH/logstash/TYPE/NAME.rb' where TYPE is 'inputs' 'filters', 'outputs' or 'codecs'
  and NAME is the name of the plugin.

-t, --configtest
  Checks configuration and then exit. Note that grok patterns are not checked for 
  correctness with this flag

-h, --help
  Print help  

-v
 *DEPRECATED: see --verbose/debug* Increase verbosity. There are multiple levels
 of verbosity available with '-vv' currently being the highest
