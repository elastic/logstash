== Getting Started with Logstash

This section guides you through the process of installing Logstash and verifying that everything is running properly. 
Later sections deal with increasingly complex configurations to address selected use cases.

=== Install Logstash

NOTE: Logstash requires Java 7 or later. Use the 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[official Oracle distribution] or an open-source 
distribution such as http://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK].

To check your Java version, run the following command:

[source,shell]
java -version

On systems with Java installed, this command produces output similar to the following:

[source,shell]
java version "1.7.0_45"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)

==== Installing from a downloaded binary

Download the https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash[Logstash installation file] that matches your host environment. 
Unpack the file. On supported Linux operating systems, you can <<package-repositories,use a package manager>> to 
install Logstash.

=== Stashing Your First Event

To test your Logstash installation, run the most basic Logstash pipeline:

[source,shell]
cd logstash-1.5.2
bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin { } } output { stdout {} }'

The `-e` flag enables you to specify a configuration directly from the command line. Specifying configurations at the 
command line lets you quickly test configurations without having to edit a file between iterations.
This pipeline takes input from the standard input, `stdin`, and moves that input to the standard output, `stdout`, in a 
structured format. Type hello world at the command prompt to see Logstash respond:

[source,shell]
hello world
2013-11-21T01:22:14.405+0000 0.0.0.0 hello world

Logstash adds timestamp and IP address information to the message. Exit Logstash by issuing a *CTRL-D* command in the 
shell where Logstash is running.

The <<advanced-pipeline,Advanced Tutorial>> expands the capabilities of your Logstash instance to cover broader 
use cases.
