=== Private Gem Repositories

The Logstash plugin manager connects to a Ruby gems repository to install and update Logstash plugins. By default, this
repository is http://rubygems.org.

Some use cases are unable to use the default repository, as in the following examples:

* A firewall blocks access to the default repository.
* You are developing your own plugins locally.
* Airgap requirements on the local system.

When you use a custom gem repository, be sure to make plugin dependencies available.

Several open source projects enable you to run your own plugin server, among them:

* https://github.com/geminabox/geminabox[Geminabox]
* https://github.com/PierreRambaud/gemirro[Gemirro]
* https://gemfury.com/[Gemfury]
* http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/[Artifactory]

==== Editing the Gemfile

The gemfile is a configuration file that specifies information required for plugin management. Each gem file has a
`source` line that specifies a location for plugin content.

By default, the gemfile's `source` line reads:

[source,shell]
----------
# This is a Logstash generated Gemfile.
# If you modify this file manually all comments and formatting will be lost.

source "https://rubygems.org"
----------

To change the source, edit the `source` line to contain your preferred source, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
----------
# This is a Logstash generated Gemfile.
# If you modify this file manually all comments and formatting will be lost.

source "https://my.private.repository"
----------

After saving the new version of the gemfile, use <<working-with-plugins,plugin management commands>> normally.
