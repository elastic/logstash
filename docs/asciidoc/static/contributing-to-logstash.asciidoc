== Contributing to Logstash

Before version 1.5, Logstash included all plugins in each release.  This made it
easy to make use of any plugin, but it complicated plugin development--a new
release of Logstash became necessary if a plugin needed patching.  Since version
1.5, all plugins are independent of the Logstash core. Now you can add your own
input, codec, filter, or output plugins to Logstash much more easily!

=== Adding plugins

Since plugins can now be developed and deployed independently of the Logstash
core, there are documents which guide you through the process of coding and
deploying your own plugins:

==== Plugin API Changes added[2.0]

The 2.0 release of Logstash changes how input plugins shut down to increase shutdown reliability. There are three methods
for plugin shutdown: `stop`, `stop?`, and `close`.

* Call the `stop` method from outside the plugin thread. This method signals the plugin to stop.
* The `stop?` method returns `true` when the `stop` method has already been called for that plugin.
* The `close` method performs final bookkeeping and cleanup after the plugin's `run` method and the plugin's thread both 
exit. The `close` method is a a new name for the method known as `teardown` in previous versions of Logstash.

The `shutdown`, `finished`, `finished?`, `running?`, and `terminating?` methods are redundant and no longer present in the 
Plugin Base class.
