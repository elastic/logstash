=== Contributing to Logstash

Before version 1.5, Logstash included all plugins in each release.  This made it
easy to make use of any plugin, but it complicated plugin development--a new
release of Logstash became necessary if a plugin needed patching.  Since version
1.5, all plugins are independent of the Logstash core. Now you can add your own
input, codec, filter, or output plugins to Logstash much more easily!

==== Adding plugins

Since plugins can now be developed and deployed independently of the Logstash
core, there are documents which guide you through the process of coding and
deploying your own plugins:
