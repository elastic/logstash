== Breaking changes

Version 2.0 of Logstash has some changes that are incompatible with previous versions of Logstash. This section discusses 
what you need to be aware of when migrating to this version.

[float]
=== Elasticsearch Output Default

Starting with the 2.0 release of Logstash, the default Logstash output for Elasticsearch is HTTP. To use the `node` or
`transport` protocols, download the {logstash}plugins-outputs-elasticsearch_java.html[Elasticsearch Java plugin]. The 
Logstash HTTP output to Elasticsearch now supports sniffing.

NOTE: The `elasticsearch_java` plugin has two versions specific to the version of the underlying Elasticsearch cluster. 
Be sure to specify the correct value for the `--version` option during installation:
* For Elasticsearch versions before 2.0, use the command 
`bin/plugin install --version 1.5.x logstash-output-elasticsearch_java`
* For Elasticsearch versions 2.0 and after, use the command 
`bin/plugin install --version 2.0.0.beta5 logstash-output-elasticsearch_java`

==== Configuration Changes

The Elasticsearch output plugin configuration has the following changes:

* The `host` configuration option is now `hosts`, allowing you to specify multiple hosts and associated ports in the 
`myhost:9200` format
* New options: `bind_host`, `bind_port`, `cluster`, `embedded`, `embedded_http_port`, `port`, `sniffing_delay`
* The `max_inflight_requests` option, which was deprecated in the 1.5 release, is now removed
* Since the `hosts` option allows specification of ports for the hosts, the redundant `port` option is now removed
* The `node_name` and `protocol` options have been moved to the `elasticsearch_java` plugin

The following deprecated configuration settings are removed in this release:

* input plugin configuration settings: `debug`, `format`, `charset`, `message_format`
* output plugin configuration settings: `type`, `tags`, `exclude_tags`.
* filter plugin configuration settings: `type`, `tags`, `exclude_tags`.

Configuration files with these settings present are invalid and prevent Logstash from starting.

=== Kafka Output Configuration Changes

The 2.0 release of Logstash includes a new version of the Kafka output plugin with significant configuration changes.
Please compare the documentation pages for the 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/1.5/plugins-outputs-kafka.html[Logstash 1.5] and
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/2.0/plugins-outputs-kafka.html[Logstash 2.0] versions of the Kafka output plugin 
and update your configuration files accordingly.

=== Filter Worker Default Change

Starting with the 2.0 release of Logstash, the default value of the `filter_workers` configuration option for filter 
plugins is half of the available CPU cores, instead of 1. This change increases parallelism in filter execution for 
resource-intensive filtering operations. You can continue to use the `-w` flag to manually set the value for this option, 
as in previous releases.
