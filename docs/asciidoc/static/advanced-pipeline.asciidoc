=== Setting Up an Advanced Logstash Pipeline

A Logstash pipeline in most use cases has one or more input, filter, and output plugins. The scenarios in this section 
build Logstash configuration files to specify these plugins and discuss what each plugin is doing.

The Logstash configuration file defines your _Logstash pipeline_. When you start a Logstash instance, use the 
`-f <path/to/file>` option to specify the configuration file that defines that instance’s pipeline.

A Logstash pipeline has two required elements, `input` and `output`, and one optional element, `filter`. The input 
plugins consume data from a source, the filter plugins modify the data as you specify, and the output plugins write 
the data to a destination.

image::static/images/basic_logstash_pipeline.png[]

The following text represents the skeleton of a configuration pipeline:

[source,shell]
# The # character at the beginning of a line indicates a comment. Use
# comments to describe your configuration.
input {
}
# The filter part of this file is commented out to indicate that it is
# optional.
# filter {
# 
# }
output {
}

This skeleton is non-functional, because the input and output sections don’t have any valid options defined. The 
examples in this tutorial build configuration files to address specific use cases.

Paste the skeleton into a file named `first-pipeline.conf` in your home Logstash directory.

[[parsing-into-es]]
==== Parsing Apache Logs into Elasticsearch

This example creates a Logstash pipeline that takes Apache web logs as input, parses those logs to create specific, 
named fields from the logs, and writes the parsed data to an Elasticsearch cluster.

You can download the sample data set used in this example 
https://download.elastic.co/demos/logstash/gettingstarted/logstash-tutorial.log.gz[here]. Unpack this file.

[[configuring-file-input]]
===== Configuring Logstash for File Input

To start your Logstash pipeline, configure the Logstash instance to read from a file using the 
{logstash}plugins-inputs-file.html[file] input plugin.

Edit the `first-pipeline.conf` file to add the following text:

[source,json]
input {
    file {
        path => "/path/to/logstash-tutorial.log"
        start_position => beginning <1>
    }
}

<1> The default behavior of the file input plugin is to monitor a file for new information, in a manner similar to the 
UNIX `tail -f` command. To change this default behavior and process the entire file, we need to specify the position 
where Logstash starts processing the file.

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to the location of `logstash-tutorial.log` in your file system.

[float]
[[configuring-grok-filter]]
===== Parsing Web Logs with the Grok Filter Plugin

The {logstash}plugins-filters-grok.html[`grok`] filter plugin is one of several plugins that are available by default in 
Logstash. For details on how to manage Logstash plugins, see the <<working-with-plugins,reference documentation>> for 
the plugin manager.

Because the `grok` filter plugin looks for patterns in the incoming log data, configuration requires you to make 
decisions about how to identify the patterns that are of interest to your use case. A representative line from the web 
server log sample looks like this:

[source,shell]
83.149.9.216 - - [04/Jan/2015:05:13:42 +0000] "GET /presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/images/kibana-search.png 
HTTP/1.1" 200 203023 "http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel 
Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36"

The IP address at the beginning of the line is easy to identify, as is the timestamp in brackets. In this tutorial, use 
the `%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}` grok pattern, which structures lines from the Apache log using the following schema:

[horizontal]
*Information*:: *Field Name*
IP Address:: `clientip`
User ID:: `ident`
User Authentication:: `auth`
timestamp:: `timestamp`
HTTP Verb:: `verb`
Request body:: `request`
HTTP Version:: `httpversion`
HTTP Status Code:: `response`
Bytes served:: `bytes`
Referrer URL:: `referrer`
User agent:: `agent`

Edit the `first-pipeline.conf` file to add the following text:

[source,json]
filter {
    grok {
        match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}"}
    }
}

After processing, the sample line has the following JSON representation:

[source,json]
{
"clientip" : "83.149.9.216",
"ident" : ,
"auth" : , 
"timestamp" : "04/Jan/2015:05:13:42 +0000",
"verb" : "GET",
"request" : "/presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/images/kibana-search.png",
"httpversion" : "HTTP/1.1",
"response" : "200",
"bytes" : "203023",
"referrer" : "http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/",
"agent" : "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36"
}

[float]
[[indexing-parsed-data-into-elasticsearch]]
===== Indexing Parsed Data into Elasticsearch

Now that the web logs are broken down into specific fields, the Logstash pipeline can index the data into an 
Elasticsearch cluster. Edit the `first-pipeline.conf` file to add the following text after the `input` section:

[source,json]
output {
    elasticsearch {
        protocol => "http"
    }
}

With this configuration, Logstash uses multicast discovery to connect to Elasticsearch. 

NOTE: Multicast discovery is acceptable for development work, but unsuited for production environments. For the 
purposes of this example, however, the default behavior is sufficient.

[float]
[[configuring-geoip-plugin]]
===== Enhancing Your Data with the Geoip Filter Plugin

In addition to parsing log data for better searches, filter plugins can derive supplementary information from existing 
data. As an example, the {logstash}plugins-filters-geoip.html[`geoip`] plugin looks up IP addresses, derives geographic 
location information from the addresses, and adds that location information to the logs.

Configure your Logstash instance to use the `geoip` filter plugin by adding the following lines to the `filter` section 
of the `first-pipeline.conf` file:

[source,json]
geoip {
    source => "clientip"
}

The `geoip` plugin configuration requires data that is already defined as separate fields. Make sure that the `geoip` 
section is after the `grok` section of the configuration file.

Specify the name of the field that contains the IP address to look up. In this tutorial, the field name is `clientip`.

[float]
[[testing-initial-pipeline]]
===== Testing Your Initial Pipeline

At this point, your `first-pipeline.conf` file has input, filter, and output sections properly configured, and looks
like this:

[source,json]
input {
    file {
        path => "/Users/palecur/logstash-1.5.2/logstash-tutorial-dataset"
        start_position => beginning
    }
}
filter {
    grok {
        match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}"}
    }
    geoip {
        source => "clientip"
    }
}
output {
    elasticsearch {
        protocol => "http"
    }
    stdout {}
}

To verify your configuration, run the following command:

[source,shell]
bin/logstash -f first-pipeline.conf --configtest

The `--configtest` option parses your configuration file and reports any errors. When the configuration file passes
the configuration test, start Logstash with the following command:

[source,shell]
bin/logstash -f first-pipeline.conf

Try a test query to Elasticsearch based on the fields created by the `grok` filter plugin:

[source,shell]
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/logstash-$DATE/_search?q=response=200'

Replace $DATE with the current date, in YYYY.MM.DD format.

Since our sample has just one 200 HTTP response, we get one hit back:

[source,json]
{"took":2,
"timed_out":false,
"_shards":{"total":5,
  "successful":5,
  "failed":0},
"hits":{"total":1,
  "max_score":1.5351382,
  "hits":[{"_index":"logstash-2015.07.30",
    "_type":"logs",
    "_id":"AU7gqOky1um3U6ZomFaF",
    "_score":1.5351382,
    "_source":{"message":"83.149.9.216 - - [04/Jan/2015:05:13:45 +0000] \"GET /presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/images/frontend-response-codes.png HTTP/1.1\" 200 52878 \"http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36\"",

      "bytes":"52878",
      "referrer":"\"http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/\"",
      "agent":"\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36\""
      }
    }]
  }
}

Try another search for the geographic information derived from the IP address:

[source,shell]
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/logstash-$DATE/_search?q=geoip.city_name=Buffalo'

Replace $DATE with the current date, in YYYY.MM.DD format.

Only one of the log entries comes from Buffalo, so the query produces a single response:

[source,json]
{"took":3,
"timed_out":false,
"_shards":{
  "total":5,
  "successful":5,
  "failed":0},

 }
}

[[multiple-input-output-plugins]]
==== Multiple Input and Output Plugins

The information you need to manage often comes from several disparate sources, and use cases can require multiple 
destinations for your data. Your Logstash pipeline can use multiple input and output plugins to handle these 
requirements.

This example creates a Logstash pipeline that takes input from a Twitter feed and the Logstash Forwarder client, then 
sends the information to an Elasticsearch cluster as well as writing the information directly to a file.

[float]
[[twitter-configuration]]
===== Reading from a Twitter feed

To add a Twitter feed, you need several pieces of information:

* A _consumer_ key, which uniquely identifies your Twitter app, which is Logstash in this case.
* A _consumer secret_, which serves as the password for your Twitter app.
* One or more _keywords_ to search in the incoming feed.
* An _oauth token_, which identifies the Twitter account using this app.
* An _oauth token secret_, which serves as the password of the Twitter account.

Visit https://dev.twitter.com/apps to set up a Twitter account and generate your consumer key and secret, as well as 
your OAuth token and secret.

Use this information to add the following lines to the `input` section of the `first-pipeline.conf` file:

[source,json]
twitter {
    consumer_key =>
    consumer_secret =>
    keywords =>
    oauth_token =>
    oauth_token_secret => 
}

[float]
[[configuring-lsf]]
===== The Logstash Forwarder

The https://github.com/elastic/logstash-forwarder[Logstash Forwarder] is a lightweight, resource-friendly tool that 
collects logs from files on the server and forwards these logs to your Logstash instance for processing. The 
Logstash Forwarder uses a secure protocol called _lumberjack_ to communicate with your Logstash instance. The 
lumberjack protocol is designed for reliability and low latency. The Logstash Forwarder uses the computing resources of 
the machine hosting the source data, and the Lumberjack input plugin minimizes the resource demands on the Logstash 
instance.

NOTE: In a typical use case, the Logstash Forwarder client runs on a separate machine from the machine running your 
Logstash instance. For the purposes of this tutorial, both Logstash and the Logstash Forwarder will be running on the
same machine.

Default Logstash configuration includes the {logstash}plugins-inputs-lumberjack.html[Lumberjack input plugin], which is 
designed to be resource-friendly. To install the Logstash Forwarder on your data source machine, install the 
appropriate package from the main Logstash https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash[product page].

Create a configuration file for the Logstash Forwarder similar to the following example:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
    "network": {
        "servers": [ "localhost:5043" ],
        "ssl ca": "/path/to/localhost.crt", <1>
        "timeout": 15
    },
    "files": [
        {
            "paths": [
                "/path/to/sample-log" <2>
            ],
            "fields": { "type": "apache" }
        }
    ]
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Path to the SSL certificate for the Logstash instance.
<2> Path to the file or files that the Logstash Forwarder processes.

Save this configuration file as `logstash-forwarder.conf`. 

Configure your Logstash instance to use the Lumberjack input plugin by adding the following lines to the `input` section 
of the `first-pipeline.conf` file:

[source,json]
lumberjack {
    port => "5043"
    ssl_certificate => "/path/to/ssl-cert" <1>
    ssl_key => "/path/to/ssl-key" <2>
}

<1> Path to the SSL certificate that the Logstash instance uses to authenticate itself to Logstash Forwarder.
<2> Path to the key for the SSL certificate.

[float]
[[logstash-file-output]]
===== Writing Logstash Data to a File

You can configure your Logstash pipeline to write data directly to a file with the 
{logstash}plugins-outputs-file.html[`file`] output plugin.

Configure your Logstash instance to use the `file` output plugin by adding the following lines to the `output` section 
of the `first-pipeline.conf` file:

[source,json]
file {
    path => /path/to/target/file
}

[float]
[[multiple-es-nodes]]
===== Writing to multiple Elasticsearch nodes

Writing to multiple Elasticsearch nodes lightens the resource demands on a given Elasticsearch node, as well as 
providing redundant points of entry into the cluster when a particular node is unavailable.

To configure your Logstash instance to write to multiple Elasticsearch nodes, edit the output section of the `first-pipeline.conf` file to read:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output {
    elasticsearch {
        protocol => "http"
        host => ["IP Address 1", "IP Address 2", "IP Address 3"]
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the IP addresses of three non-master nodes in your Elasticsearch cluster in the host line. When the `host` 
parameter lists multiple IP addresses, Logstash load-balances requests across the list of addresses.

[float]
[[testing-second-pipeline]]
===== Testing the Pipeline

At this point, your `first-pipeline.conf` file looks like this:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input {
    twitter {
        consumer_key =>
        consumer_secret =>
        keywords =>
        oauth_token =>
        oauth_token_secret =>
    }
    lumberjack {
        port => "5043"
        ssl_certificate => "/path/to/ssl-cert"
        ssl_key => "/path/to/ssl-key"
    }
}
output {
    elasticsearch {
        protocol => "http"
        host => ["IP Address 1", "IP Address 2", "IP Address 3"]
    }
    file {
        path => /path/to/target/file
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logstash is consuming data from the Twitter feed you configured, receiving data from the Logstash Forwarder, and 
indexing this information to three nodes in an Elasticsearch cluster as well as writing to a file.

At the data source machine, run the Logstash Forwarder with the following command:

[source,shell]
logstash-forwarder -config logstash-forwarder.conf

Logstash Forwarder will attempt to connect on port 5403. Until Logstash starts with an active Lumberjack plugin, there 
won’t be any answer on that port, so any messages you see regarding failure to connect on that port are normal for now.

To verify your configuration, run the following command:

[source,shell]
bin/logstash -f first-pipeline.conf --configtest

The `--configtest` option parses your configuration file and reports any errors. When the configuration file passes
the configuration test, start Logstash with the following command:

[source,shell]
bin/logstash -f first-pipeline.conf

Use the `grep` utility to search in the target file to verify that information is present:

[source,shell]
grep Mozilla /path/to/target/file

Run an Elasticsearch query to find the same information in the Elasticsearch cluster:

[source,shell]
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/logstash-2015.07.30/_search?q=agent=Mozilla'
