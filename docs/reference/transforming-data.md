# Transforming data [transformation]

With over 200 plugins in the Logstash plugin ecosystem, it’s sometimes challenging to choose the best plugin to meet your data processing needs. In this section, we’ve collected a list of popular plugins and organized them according to their processing capabilities:

* [Performing Core Operations](/reference/core-operations.md)
* [Deserializing Data](/reference/data-deserialization.md)
* [Extracting Fields and Wrangling Data](/reference/field-extraction.md)
* [Enriching Data with Lookups](/reference/lookup-enrichment.md)

Also see [*Filter plugins*](logstash-docs-md://lsr/filter-plugins.md) and [*Codec plugins*](logstash-docs-md://lsr/codec-plugins.md) for the full list of available data processing plugins.
