Â 

### `host` [plugins-outputs-xmpp-host]

* Value type is [string](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#string)
* There is no default value for this setting.

The xmpp server to connect to. This is optional. If you omit this setting, the host on the user/identity is used. (foo.com for `user@foo.com`)


### `message` [plugins-outputs-xmpp-message]

* This is a required setting.
* Value type is [string](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#string)
* There is no default value for this setting.

The message to send. This supports dynamic strings like `%{{host}}`


### `password` [plugins-outputs-xmpp-password]

* This is a required setting.
* Value type is [password](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#password)
* There is no default value for this setting.

The xmpp password for the user/identity.


### `rooms` [plugins-outputs-xmpp-rooms]

* Value type is [array](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#array)
* There is no default value for this setting.

if muc/multi-user-chat required, give the name of the room that you want to join: room@conference.domain/nick


### `user` [plugins-outputs-xmpp-user]

* Value type is [string](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#string)

## Common options [plugins-outputs-xmpp-common-options]

These configuration options are supported by all output plugins:

| Setting | Input type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`codec`](#plugins-outputs-xmpp-codec) | [codec](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#codec) | No |
| [`enable_metric`](#plugins-outputs-xmpp-enable_metric) | [boolean](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#boolean) | No |
| [`id`](#plugins-outputs-xmpp-id) | [string](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#string) | No |

### `codec` [plugins-outputs-xmpp-codec]

* Value type is [codec](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#codec)
* Default value is `"plain"`

The codec used for output data. Output codecs are a convenient method for encoding your data before it leaves the output without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.


### `enable_metric` [plugins-outputs-xmpp-enable_metric]

* Value type is [boolean](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#boolean)
* Default value is `true`

Disable or enable metric logging for this specific plugin instance. By default we record all the metrics we can, but you can disable metrics collection for a specific plugin.


### `id` [plugins-outputs-xmpp-id]

* Value type is [string](/reference/configuration-file-structure.md#string)
* There is no default value for this setting.

Add a unique `ID` to the plugin configuration. If no ID is specified, Logstash will generate one. It is strongly recommended to set this ID in your configuration. This is particularly useful when you have two or more plugins of the same type. For example, if you have 2 xmpp outputs. Adding a named ID in this case will help in monitoring Logstash when using the monitoring APIs.

```json
output {
  xmpp {
    id => "my_plugin_id"
  }
}
```

::::{note}
Variable substitution in the `id` field only supports environment variables and does not support the use of values from the secret store.
