/////
These settings control attributes in the LSR only. 
They correspond to the VPR settings in logstash-docs/docs/versioned-plugins/include/attributes-ls-vpr.asciidoc
When we update one, we must update settings in the other location,

Attribute text formatted without hard wrap is deliberate. 
Otherwise, text breaks at return and content after the return is dropped. 

Text is written to accommodate multiple versions because plugins are not stack versioned.

:ecs-default: When the `ecs_compatibility` option for this plugin is not explicitly set, its effective value depends on the `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting for the pipeline in `pipelines.yml`, or globally in {logstash-ref}/logstash-settings-file.html[`logstash.yml`], allowing you to specify your preferred behavior at the plugin, pipeline, or system level. If no preference is specified, the default value is `v8` for Logstash 8 or `disabled` for all earlier releases of Logstash. For more information about ECS compatibility settings in Logstash and plugins, see {logstash-ref}/ecs-ls.html[ECS in Logstash].
