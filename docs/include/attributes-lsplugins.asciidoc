/////
These settings control attributes in the LSR only. 
They correspond to the VPR settings in logstash-docs/docs/versioned-plugins/include/attributes-ls-vpr.asciidoc
When we update one, we must update settings in the other location,

Attribute text formatted without hard wrap is deliberate. 
Otherwise, text breaks at return and content after the return is dropped. 

Text is written to accommodate multiple versions because plugins are not stack versioned.

:ecs-default: When Logstash provides a pipeline.ecs_compatibility setting, its value is used as the default. Otherwise, the default value depends on which version of Logstash you are running: `disabled` for Logstash 7.x or `v8` for  Logstash 8.0 and later. You can opt out at the plugin, pipeline, or system level to maintain legacy behavior. For more information about ECS compatibility settings in Logstash and plugins, see {logstash-ref}/ls-ecs.
