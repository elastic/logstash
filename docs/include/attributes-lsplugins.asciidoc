These settings control attributes in the LSR only. 
They correspond to the VPR settings in logstash-docs/docs/versioned-plugins/include/attributes-ls-vpr.asciidoc
When we update one, we must update settings in the other location,

Attribute text formatted without hard wrap is deliberate. 
Otherwise, text breaks at return and content isn't displayed in its entirety.

:ecs-default: The `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` setting is available in {logstash-ref}/logstash-settings-file.html[`logstash.yml`] and `pipelines.yml`. Any value in `pipeline.ecs_compatibility` other than `disabled` is considered BETA and unsupported until Logstash 8.0 and the final 7.x version are released. Having this pipeline level flag set will cause even patch-level upgrades to automatically consume breaking changes in the upgraded plugins, changing the shape of data the plugin produces.
