##########################
# Settings have an implicit initialization life-cycle, this helper exists to aid with the reading the settings.
#
# Defaults are read from "logstash/environment"
# SettingsHelper.pre_process - registers defaults unavailable from "logstash/environment"
# SettingsHelper.from_yaml - finds yaml based on "--path.settings" and updates defaults if needed.
# SettingsHelper.post_process - callback to re-calculate derived settings
#
# The methods should be called in the above order before the settings are ready to be used.
