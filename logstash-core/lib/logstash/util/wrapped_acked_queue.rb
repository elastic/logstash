  # not the internal implementation e.g. LogStash::AckedMemoryQueue etc.
  # Note the use of allocate - this is what new does before it calls initialize.
  # Note that the new method has been made private this is because there is no
  # default queue implementation.
  # It would be expensive to create a persistent queue in the new method
  # to then throw it away in favor of a memory based one directly after.
  # Especially in terms of (mmap) memory allocation and proper close sequencing.
