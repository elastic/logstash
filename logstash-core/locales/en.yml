      flag:
        # Note: Wrap these at 55 chars so they display nicely when clamp emits
        # them in an 80-character terminal
        config: |+
          Load the logstash config from a specific file
          or directory.  If a directory is given, all
          files in that directory will be concatenated
          in lexicographical order and then parsed as a
          single config file. You can also specify
          wildcards (globs) and any matched files will
          be loaded in the order described above.
        config-string: |+
          Use the given string as the configuration
          data. Same syntax as the config file. If no
          input is specified, then the following is
          used as the default input:
          "%{default_input}"
          and if no output is specified, then the
          following is used as the default output:
          "%{default_output}"
          If you wish to use both defaults, please use
          the empty string for the '-e' flag.
        configtest: |+
          Check configuration for valid syntax and then exit.
        pipeline-workers: |+
          Sets the number of pipeline workers to run.
        filterworkers: |+
          DEPRECATED. Now an alias for --pipeline-workers and -w
        pipeline-batch-size: |+
          Size of batches the pipeline is to work in.
        pipeline-batch-delay: |+
          When creating pipeline batches, how long to wait while polling
          for the next event.
        log: |+
          Write logstash internal logs to the given
          file. Without this flag, logstash will emit
          logs to standard output.
        verbosity: |+
          Increase verbosity of logstash internal logs.
          Specifying once will show 'informational'
          logs. Specifying twice will show 'debug'
          logs. This flag is deprecated. You should use
          --verbose or --debug instead.
        version: |+
          Emit the version of logstash and its friends,
          then exit.
        pluginpath: |+
          A path of where to find plugins. This flag
          can be given multiple times to include
          multiple paths. Plugins are expected to be
          in a specific directory hierarchy:
          'PATH/logstash/TYPE/NAME.rb' where TYPE is
          'inputs' 'filters', 'outputs' or 'codecs'
          and NAME is the name of the plugin.
        quiet: |+
          Quieter logstash logging. This causes only 
          errors to be emitted.
        verbose: |+
          More verbose logging. This causes 'info' 
          level logs to be emitted.
        debug: |+
          Most verbose logging. This causes 'debug'
          level logs to be emitted.
        unsafe_shutdown: |+
          Force logstash to exit during shutdown even
          if there are still inflight events in memory.
          By default, logstash will refuse to quit until all
          received events have been pushed to the outputs.
