  # This patch comes after an investigation of `generate_plugins_version`
  # causing OOM during `./gradlew generatePluginsVersion`.
  # Why does this patch fix the issue? Hang on, this is going to be wild ride:
  # In this rake task we compute a manifest that tells us, for each logstash plugin,
  # what is the latest version that can be installed.
  # We do this by (again for each plugin):
  # * adding the plugin to the current Gemfile
  # * instantiate a `Bundler::Dsl` instance with said Gemfile
  # * retrieve a Bundler::Definition by passing in the Gemfile.lock
  # * call `definition.resolve_remotely!
  #
  # Now, these repeated calls to `resolve_remotely!` on new instances of Definitions
  # cause the out of memory. Resolving remote dependencies uses Bundler::Worker instances
  # who trap the SIGINT signal in their `initializer` [1]. This shared helper method creates a closure that is
  # passed to `Signal.trap`, and capture the return [2], which is the previous proc (signal handler).
  # Since the variable that stores the return from `Signal.trap` is present in the binding, multiple calls
  # to this helper cause each new closures to reference the previous one. The size of each binding
  # accumulates and OOM occurs after 70-100 iterations.
  # This is easy to replicate by looping over `Bundler::SharedHelpers.trap("INT") { 1 }`.
  # 
  # This workaround removes the capture of the previous binding. Not calling all the previous handlers
  # may cause some threads to not be cleaned up, but this rake task has a short life so everything 
  # ends up being cleaned up on exit anyway.
  # We're confining this patch to this task only as this is the only place where we need to resolve 
  # dependencies many many times.
  #
  # You're still here? You're awesome :) Thanks for reading!
